"But when I finally do, it'll be the years biggest shit ^^^^^so ^^^^^far"
"Somewhere out there, somebody has made the biggest poop of the year. And they don't even know it. "
I made my biggest poop of last year right in between Christmas and New year's- first time I could say that I filled the bowl to the waterline
goals
A friend of mine left a 12-15 inch long shit that had to be at least 3 inches thick in a bowl years back. Literally ripped his asshole delivering it. About 6 of us were standing over the toilet in speedos perplexed by what we saw in front of us. Probably a solid 3 minutes of us just staring at shit before our coach broke our trance by asking us what the hell we were all doing.
"When I was a sophomore in high school, I decided to use the school bathroom.Normally, I would never do this for 2 reasons. 1, I hate using public bathrooms period. Unless I cleaned it, it's disgusting. 2, I've had bowel issues all my life where I wont be able to go for a week at  a time, sometimes longer (I've gotten much better with this in recent years.) Now, unfortunately, I had been 2 weeks since I had gone and my body decided the time to go was 11am on a Wednesday in the middle of class. I get a pass, head to restroom, and very quickly remove several pounds of trash from my body. But, here's the thing. As the poop was moving out, it stopped. I suddenly realized it had hit the bottom of the toilet but there was still poop connected IN ME. So I had to slowly stand up while STILL POOPING to finish. It came about two to three inches over the lid and was literally steaming. I freaked out, washed my hands and got out of the bathroom before anyone else showed up to see my child in the toilet. To this day, my largest shit, and one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. (Also, it wasn't thin. The width matched the length. Don't ask how I didn't need medical attention after that, cause i have no clue)"
Did it get clogged
"Nope, wend down easy - left a load of skidmarks though."
Happy cake day
And the smallest shit. Schrodinger's shit
I've been pissing out my ass all fuckin day.
You have had this account for 4 years and the only posts on it are fairly disturbing....

Lmao! Thank heavens no!
Bold of you to assume I'm going to take a shit this year.

"Fun fact, If you don't poop for long enough it will literally back up into your stomach and you will throw up shit and become septic. I knew a woman on methadone who became so constipated she stopped pooping and didn't do anything about it until she started vomiting up shit and almost died. I can't even imagine what the process of clearing 28ft (8.53m) of mostly hard dried up shit from your intestines is like after that if you survive"
That was not a fun fact at all.

I didn’t poop for a couple weeks a few months back. When I finally went to the hospital they gave me a pill to put up my butt and a jug of cherry flavoured laxative to chug. I lost 15 lbs
15 lbs = 6 Courics. You still have a long way to go to beat Randy Marsh.

"Hmm. That's a good question. Yeah but Mr. Slave was a pro. There was a lot of traffic back there. 

Shit (so to speak) now you're reminding me...what was the episode with Lemmiwinks?? Was that also Mr. Slave??"
Hot HOT HOT!
Guess you can say you really didn't give a shit
I didn't poop for over a week while traveling once for some reason. As soon as I got home I took the biggest shit of my life. 
"So am I to understand that all I actually need to do to achieve my entire 2019 weight-loss goal is acquire a butt plug \[check\] and mix a little cheeky laxative into a bottle of cherry Tango? 

&#x200B;"
How did that feel when it crested the horizon? I just imagine a spine chilling orgasm as it all just coiled up like an chalky snake. 
It was a terrible experience which took a hour. However I did sleep for 16 hours after
That’s legit horrifying.
That's enough reddit for me for today.
I wonder how you get the taste of your own poop out of your mouth?
Gargle with your tears.

We have guests and I literally can't relax.
"Ahhh, I see I'm not the only one with poop anxiety "
I consider wolves to be stronger and deadlier than coyotes
Good to know im not the only one. I get poop anxiety as well especially at work!
Me too! And it always seems like nobody will be near the bathroom until I sit down for 'Ol Deucie...then they're having conversations 2 ft away on the other side of the door 😖
"You sound lucky enough to have a private bathroom.

My work bathroom is two stalls and a urinal and we share it with the entire floor. If I walk in there needing to poop and somebody is already in there, I just turn around and go back to work. I'll try again later.

How anybody can sit two feet away from another human being while you're both shitting and be okay with it is beyond me. "
The one who poops loudest wins.
"Had a coworker that couldn’t poop in the stall if anyone else was in the bathroom.  He confided this in me.  One day, I decided since I make a nickel, boss makes a dime, I was gonna poop on company time.  Entered the bathroom, one stall occupied, nbd, I’ll just use the other.  As soon as I sit down I hear the other person get up to leave. I call my poop-shy friends name out softly followed by a few fake coughs to save myself from any potential awkwardness of it not being him.  He then calls my name out in return.  He ends up being comfortable enough to do his duty.  It was a beautiful moment.  Maybe I’ve found my calling?"
The poop whisperer?

I went overseas and couldn’t poop for the whole week long trip. I really tried but no go. So trust me. You’re not alone 
My anxiety causes me to poop. 
"While friends were here today for football, I snuck away for my own bowl game."
"Go somewhere else. This is the test of a true friend. You could shit in my guest bathroom any old time buddy, you hang in there"

Everyone now thinking about the last time they pooped. Nicely played. 
What a shitty thought 
When you have a caffeine addiction you don't need to think that far back.
"Is it all caffeine, or just coffee? Because I don't think that pop or energy drinks have the same effect on me. I definitely pee a lot more. But I think it's just coffee that makes me punish the porcelain. That and throwing in a chew. Why am I typing all this out. "
Some types of coffee makes me poop almost immediately. But not all.
"Hot drip coffee is like this for me. A single cup makes me poop like 4 times a day when I normally poop about once every other day. Therefore I tend to avoid it unless I need a good thorough clean out (which, granted, can be very satisfying if I have a free day for it)."
How do you know when you need to flush the pipe?
"Oh, you know.  "
"> Why am I typing all this out.

this last detail really made me chuckle"
"I drink 24-48 oz of coffee aday but it doesn't make me shit. Do I need to drink more coffee, I just shit at 5am every morning. "
Try a coffee enema
"Caffeine and hot liquids, if I drink caffeine free pop im fine but if I have a coke or redbull forget about it. Add some snus or juul hit and its game over"

r/opiates is probably gonna win that one. 
Yeah... I'm on Oxycodone because I had my tonsils taken out. Haven't pooped in 7 days... I don't feel constipated though. I've been on mostly a liquid diet.
"I was on morphine (after breaking my leg and having surgery) for a week without any laxatives. I think it was 7-10 days before I pooped and it was horrible!!! At one point I couldn't push anymore and my butt tried sucking it back up. Had to break that shit off because I'd gone through so much trying to get it out. 

For my following surgery I was on oxy and made sure I was given laxatives. I did not want to go through that again. "
"Protip, press on your perineum/ taint region if you have a turtle popping out like that. Its similar to squeezing the edge of a pimple to force out the pus. Sounds gross and wierd, it is, but it works. Just kinda massage that taint. 

Source: certified uncle, assisted at least 1 constipated baby in making poo. "
"Ever since I was born, I could go several days without pooping. There were months where I could count on one hand how many times I popped, lol. I used to have really bad stomach aches due to it, but now it’s kinda like meh. I’ll poop eventually. My body is weird. Haha"
"Diet, hydration and exercise are the main factors typically. Your body likely isn’t that weird. "
"The same happened to me! I was pushing 2 weeks and no one ever told me I needed to tape stool softeners to help stay regular. I was super stoked when I finally had the urge to poop, but it was probably the worst one I’ve ever had. The worst part was it crawling back in when I stopped pushing. I really wish I had read about the poop knife before then"
"I’m on Oxycodone too! Except mine is because I got cancer last May, and it’s to help with the horrible pains of chemotherapy and radiation. The constipation is awful lol"
"Most laxatives don't work great when you have that issue, they are very rapid so you'll get all the stomach pain like you have diarrhea but you will still be blocked by a solid piece of stool holding everything in (horrible experience). The best option is to use magnesium citrate, get the bottled stuff from Walmart ($0.99 in cherry or lemon). It will work in about 12 hours and it kind of moistens your colon so it comes out smoothly. Don't over do it, only drink a quarter of the bottle and then another quarter if it hasn't worked after 12 hours. "
Oh I didn't know opiates would do that
"Former heroin addict. On suboxone now, can confirm. My ass bleeds almost every time I take a shit. 


Dont do drugs."
"Yeah, I'm a 12+ year heroin user, so I know all too well about the Arizona cans once every 10 days. I've gotten better the past 2 years of letting myself get sick enough to get it out before getting right. Lack of funds helps that too lol. "
Oh god after my leg surgery... It was titanic when it finally happened.
"Had jaw surgery and was on morphine for a couple days, also was on a liquid diet. I was given laxatives and was made to drink berry juice. Didn’t have a shit for three weeks. When I was finally able to bang one it was this disappointing little squiggle."
"I remember when I went to camp as a kid, I didn't poop the entire time. 1 full week. I didn't even know that was possible, but I just didn't have to go."
"Ive been there chief. Took a 9 day trip to NYC including travel time. Didnt poop once, ate three meals a day. Just didn't need to go. "
"Did you drop a 50lb log after getting home, or was it spread out over several quick shits in one day?"
"I didnt deuce for a day or two after I got back, then it was two of em like fat man & little boy. Then back to normal"
Respect.
Glad it worked out that way. Could have led to impacted stool. Not fun. I assume.
"It’s awful. I got impacted the last time I was pregnant. No one told me prenatal pills and pregnancy slowing your digestive system causes constipation and you should take something if you haven’t shit in a few days. I went a week, and had to be disimpacted."
Disimpacted?????
Someone gets to reach in you and get it out. Yes thats exactly what it sounds like.
"Doctor here. Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. It’s usually saved as a very very last resort (after enemas fail). Don’t worry, lots and lots of lube is used.

Fun fact: it’s the one of the things they “let” the medical student do. (More like force) Fortunately, I survived my medical training without having to do one. Probably because I have huge hands."
"Yeah. I’m a nurse. It’s a lot of fun for both nurse and patient. But the relief they feel is worth it (I guess if you’re a caring nurse, which I am)."
"I did this after having my baby.  Poop spoon upthread reminded me that I considered doing that.  Used my finger instead.  Picked away at some, and the pressure collapsed the poop onto itself until I pooped.  No fucking fun at all.  When picking at your poop is the best option you know you are fucked.  That was after the laxatives I finally asked for."
"Nurse here. I once had a patient who was so confused she literally couldn't tell us her own name.  I had to disimpact her, which I did as gently as I possible could have.  

She couldn't remember her name, but for DAYS, whenever anyone came into the room (including me,) she would say, ""Do you know what they DID to me?!?""  "
"I got constipated after giving birth. I was drinking about double what I normally do, but apparently being in the aircon 24/7 and breastfeeding meant that I was dehydrated, even though I was drinking about 3 litres of fluid a day. When one of the nurses asked me if I had ""moved my bowels"" since the birth I told her no ... it was 4 days since the birth. She looked alarmed and got me some laxatives. I went the next day and honest to God, it felt like I was giving birth again. Biggest poop I've ever dropped. "
Like fat man n little boy LMAO.... Jesus dude xD take my upvote already
Amateurs! I've done 14 days personal record. Would not recommend.
Wait youre telling me its not Normal to poop once every one or two weeks? Literally done that all my life
"There was that one chick that posted (I think in the beginning of the year) that hadn't pooped for like 2 weeks or something. Looked like she was pregnant.

Rosebuds on the other hand are ok
">**PUSH**, but don't forget to breathe in ~~between~~ during pushes . he he ho ho

Holding your breath while pushing or exerting force increases intra thoracic pressure and vascular resistance making one prone to hemorrhoids.  Additionally, it's a great way to stimulate a vaso-vagal response slowing down the heart and lower blood pressure.  You could literally pass out from pooping if you strain. "
"Drink some water, eat some fiber, take a walk"

You can get away with a lot when you're younger, but it starts to catch up with you, even when your numbers were all ""good"" in your 20s and 30s. I had to lose a lot of weight in my 20s, and I'm still far from perfect, but I know how hard it is to make some of those changes.

You can do it. Don't let this setback get you down. Do what you need to do for your health. I fucked up a lot, but it's the cumulative effect that makes the difference. Don't give up! You'll get through this, and 2019 is going to be awesome for you."
Toradol?  Only time in my life I’ve been completely pain free was hooked up to an IV drip of that good shit.
So I open up Reddit as I'm taking my 1st 2019 shit. Nice
Cause i only shit every 2-3 days
Oooooh same and everyone thinks that’s so fucking weird. 
had a morning poop and an afternoon poop.  both very nice!
Are you... Are you *the* rimjob_steve? From r/rimjob_steve?
that’s me!
10/10 quality shitpost
I pooped immediately after my 5 am shower. Real shitty way to start the new year.
The past haunts me no matter how hard i push.
"Wow. By the time I was half way reading this headline I became disqualified from answering this question.

I just unloaded ALL of last years shit. 
Too much Turkey and stuffing and potatoes. My stomach is a brick.

I had a Donner Kebab last night sunshine. No fucking way I could hold onto that for long. Launched this morning like a Chilean mudslide...
I ate a ribeye at 2am last night. Things are processing slowly. 
"I had surgery a week ago and the stitches are located right at the top of my buttcrack. At first, pooping was something that my stitches could handle, but the last 2 days have been a nightmare. Every time I bend the wrong way, including sitting on the toilet, my incision bleeds. Seeing the doctor tomorrow, but until then- no pooping for me. "

Cheese
why is this the top of all time
A side effect I get from one of my meds is constipation.  So yeah. 
Because I just left the doctors and have the stomach flu. Haven't eaten anything in 4 days. Not the way I intended to ring in the New Year. 
Jokes on you! Im shitting right now!
Codine + morphine sulphate = uncomfortable side effects.
I just saw this literally as I was taking a shit
I’m at least 4 shits into 2019.   I had Gumbo last night as well as 8-10 glasses of IPA.  Needless to say I have some killer 2018 gas right now.  Today’s cabbage isn’t helping much.

Bold of you to assume I can poop

I'M NOT POOPING TILL THE GOVERNMENT COMES BACK ON!!

Oh *shit*! You're right!
Reddit has become a quality site over the years..

Why the hell is this top post of all time
Pretty sure this is unhealthy.
"At this point,you better see a doctor. "
Well I would just like to welcome the strangest normies of Reddit into this odd portion of the new section of this old post
Is anyone still filled up?
It’s beginning to be an issue 
Every day I spot this thread (searching keywords by top this year) I chuckle a little more.
Just pooped for the first time this year
Still going strong
Busy wondering how I’ve made it so far.
Its now April 9th...so I really hope y'all have pooped by now.
I still haven’t
"It’s June and I still haven’t taken a shit yet, I’m waiting till 2020."
"It’s now june the 4th, still holding it in. My shit has grown to such a size that it’s beginning to develop it’s own gravitational field."
I'm still holding it
Reddit finally removed archiving! Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!!!!!!!!11
*what a wonderful time to be alive*
first day of 2019 and i’ve got the worst diarrhoea ever. i even shat myself while walking and had to walk home with shite everywhere. fucking ridiculous.
Currently day 19 of holding in last years poop god can only help me
Yes... January was a rough month
I probably need to see a doctor
It is currently May 3rd and I am still holding in my 2017 shit
planning on making my shit last until 2021
Hello random stranger that went to the top post of all time then sorted by new comments :)
"The most upvoted post of all time on this sub is about poop.

Great job, reddit."
This is the most upvoted post on here?
Just popped my first one of the year
Lame and unfunny. Askreddit is prob the worst popular sub with all the dumb shit. 
"Ha! I let out a LOG earlier and, of course, opened the door to yell to my girlfriend that I just set the record for 2019’s longest turd. I was proud"
its all i have from lst year i wanan keep it
"I’m already on poop #2 (since I woke up, at least. could technically be poop 3 for all I remember.)"
I went to an all you can eat steak house last night. I expect I’ll be backed up until the 3rd.
Just dropped it.
I'm pooping right now
"Just took laxitives, so it's on it's way out soon"
As I sit here on the toilet...
Oh my god this post is hilarious. 
I have popped the total amount of seven times today. Letting that shit go. 
Saving it for 2020
"Too little fiber in my diet. I'm still holding on to 2017, too."
"This isn’t the answer you were looking for but after reading the comments, I’m pretty proud of myself. I’ve had a stomach bug for the past few days so I got off the toilet at 11:58 to kiss the fiancé, and went right back in afterwards"
Woke up with a stomach ache and sank the biggest shit bigger than an iceberg
I’m too pooped to poo because I’ve been watching too much Winnie The Pooh and Timone and Poomba in the dark as I poofed my candles out. 
I just got on the toilet and this is the first post that came up. 
I'm glad I could help you move on
"I hate laughing at ‘AskReddits’.... but here I am, chuckling "
well this hits way too close to home. i just cant let go of shit. Lol
"Wow, I actually took this to heart. Realized I was already fucking up! Let it go. Back to working on my first ever goal..tree? because I wanted to be realistic so I'm trying to break it down.. but I got discouraged. So thank you, shitty stranger. <3"
I actually just let go of last year's shit. In my grandma's bathroom. Then I had to ask for a plunger. I told her to be honored that I took my first poop of the year at her house.
Bro I'm taking my first shit of 2019 as we speak

I'm now home eating a huge meal because my tummy is empty.

Didnt have to until you said that. Now its a game. And I will win. No shit 19 lets do this
I remember 2018 like it was yesterday 
BC LAST YEAR WAS SHITTY AF
Guess where I commenting from?
I feel like you thought of this months ago and have been waiting for this moment.
I win.  I haven’t pooped since a similar post from 2018! 
It's not last year. Its 2015's
It’s been 3 weeks how haven’t y’all dumped yet 
I haven’t had to go yet

"Somewhere out there, somebody has made the biggest poop of the year. And they don't even know it. "
I made my biggest poop of last year right in between Christmas and New year's- first time I could say that I filled the bowl to the waterline
goals
A friend of mine left a 12-15 inch long shit that had to be at least 3 inches thick in a bowl years back. Literally ripped his asshole delivering it. About 6 of us were standing over the toilet in speedos perplexed by what we saw in front of us. Probably a solid 3 minutes of us just staring at shit before our coach broke our trance by asking us what the hell we were all doing.
"When I was a sophomore in high school, I decided to use the school bathroom.Normally, I would never do this for 2 reasons. 1, I hate using public bathrooms period. Unless I cleaned it, it's disgusting. 2, I've had bowel issues all my life where I wont be able to go for a week at  a time, sometimes longer (I've gotten much better with this in recent years.) Now, unfortunately, I had been 2 weeks since I had gone and my body decided the time to go was 11am on a Wednesday in the middle of class. I get a pass, head to restroom, and very quickly remove several pounds of trash from my body. But, here's the thing. As the poop was moving out, it stopped. I suddenly realized it had hit the bottom of the toilet but there was still poop connected IN ME. So I had to slowly stand up while STILL POOPING to finish. It came about two to three inches over the lid and was literally steaming. I freaked out, washed my hands and got out of the bathroom before anyone else showed up to see my child in the toilet. To this day, my largest shit, and one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. (Also, it wasn't thin. The width matched the length. Don't ask how I didn't need medical attention after that, cause i have no clue)"
Did it get clogged
"Nope, wend down easy - left a load of skidmarks though."
Happy cake day

"Fun fact, If you don't poop for long enough it will literally back up into your stomach and you will throw up shit and become septic. I knew a woman on methadone who became so constipated she stopped pooping and didn't do anything about it until she started vomiting up shit and almost died. I can't even imagine what the process of clearing 28ft (8.53m) of mostly hard dried up shit from your intestines is like after that if you survive"
That was not a fun fact at all.

I didn’t poop for a couple weeks a few months back. When I finally went to the hospital they gave me a pill to put up my butt and a jug of cherry flavoured laxative to chug. I lost 15 lbs

Hot HOT HOT!
Guess you can say you really didn't give a shit
I didn't poop for over a week while traveling once for some reason. As soon as I got home I took the biggest shit of my life. 
"So am I to understand that all I actually need to do to achieve my entire 2019 weight-loss goal is acquire a butt plug \[check\] and mix a little cheeky laxative into a bottle of cherry Tango? 

&#x200B;"
How did that feel when it crested the horizon? I just imagine a spine chilling orgasm as it all just coiled up like an chalky snake. 
It was a terrible experience which took a hour. However I did sleep for 16 hours after
That’s legit horrifying.
That's enough reddit for me for today.
I wonder how you get the taste of your own poop out of your mouth?
Gargle with your tears.
You guys gearing up for don't-pee-january?
"Ahhh, I see I'm not the only one with poop anxiety "
I consider wolves to be stronger and deadlier than coyotes
Good to know im not the only one. I get poop anxiety as well especially at work!
Me too! And it always seems like nobody will be near the bathroom until I sit down for 'Ol Deucie...then they're having conversations 2 ft away on the other side of the door 😖
"You sound lucky enough to have a private bathroom.

My work bathroom is two stalls and a urinal and we share it with the entire floor. If I walk in there needing to poop and somebody is already in there, I just turn around and go back to work. I'll try again later.

How anybody can sit two feet away from another human being while you're both shitting and be okay with it is beyond me. "
The one who poops loudest wins.
"Had a coworker that couldn’t poop in the stall if anyone else was in the bathroom.  He confided this in me.  One day, I decided since I make a nickel, boss makes a dime, I was gonna poop on company time.  Entered the bathroom, one stall occupied, nbd, I’ll just use the other.  As soon as I sit down I hear the other person get up to leave. I call my poop-shy friends name out softly followed by a few fake coughs to save myself from any potential awkwardness of it not being him.  He then calls my name out in return.  He ends up being comfortable enough to do his duty.  It was a beautiful moment.  Maybe I’ve found my calling?"
The poop whisperer? 
Log therapist
I went overseas and couldn’t poop for the whole week long trip. I really tried but no go. So trust me. You’re not alone 
My anxiety causes me to poop. 
"While friends were here today for football, I snuck away for my own bowl game."
"Go somewhere else. This is the test of a true friend. You could shit in my guest bathroom any old time buddy, you hang in there"
 I can't relax when strangers are around. It's not just pooping it's a my time to relax!!
Aw man what a terrible way to spend NYE! I hope you feel better soon bud!

"Where at? I was puking all day saturday..I couldn't keep down even water and thought my skin looked a strange color so I thought I should go to the doctor..Was extremely weak too. Some anti-vomit/nausea medicine and an IV and I felt better in a few hours.

I kinda wonder if I actually should have gone or if I should have toughened it out for 24 hours and hoped to get better.. I have no one to take care of me while I'm sick and I was worried of becoming ""too sick"" too..

-edit.. I live in socal seems to be going around the US?..Weird thing is that I hardly go out and get in contact with people. Like I can pinpoint exactly where I got it from and when.. Which was when I went out for some fast food on friday night..It was my favorite place so maybe one of the employees got sick a few days earlier and didn't wash enough? or a customer got sick and their sick germs were all over the place.. I do know the norovirus is extremely contagious..

Was also wondering if I should call them and tell them I got the stomach flu from their place or not.."
If you're already feeling better it sounds like you made the right choice by going. Don't ever underestimate the power of dehydration. I'm glad you're doing better already! Happy New Year :)
You’re a sweet person. 
Such a wholesome comment! Dehydration is serious and I’ve been close to the emergency room a few times. Especially when alcohol is involved.
I'm in NE Ohio. But my sister's whole family had it last week and they're 3 hours west of me. I don't have anyone to take care of me either. I miss my mom in times like this. lol
Oh man me too but I ended up on the ER. ER on Dec is a fucking gong show.
"I always go, if I can't keep anything down, I go. I was hospitalized once for norovirus and dehydration, so I don't mess around. Last time I went, I got a script for an antinausia med and they told me I could come back to be hooked up to a saline drip in the future (instead of going to the ER, going to their IV room thing)."
Never trust a fart. 
"The exact same thing happened to me. We're in this together! Stay hydrated, bud."
"I'm scared to eat. What do you recommend? I tried eating instant noodles (soft and soupy). I thought I was feeling better but it all came out and had indigestion all night. So far I'm surviving on saltine crackers and coconut water. Grapes seem kind to me so far, but my stomach is still making noises..."
same :(
That was me too this NYE (mine started at 5:30am) but I had both the diarrhea and vomit. So much for going out to a party with my crush instead I was asleep before 11pm. 🤷🏼‍♀️ 
"I had that same bug. It hit me Wednesday night last week. I was fortunate not to vomit, I hate vomiting. 

But I shit a stream for 4 hours last Wednesday night, most of the day Thursday I slept (14+ hours) and didn't feel quite right most of the day Saturday and Sunday. Early in the hours of Monday AM, I farted in my sleep and I felt it, I shit myself with a liquid fart, and proceeded to have a relapse of diahrea for another 2 hours. Fortunately, I caught just a small bit of it and didn't make any mess outside of my sleep shorts. I felt terrible Monday, and put myself on the BRAT (Bananas, Applesauce, Rice, Toast) diet for the day yesterday, and today I feel like a new man. 

Edit: auto corrected word. 

"
"Same shit happened to me too, but I can't hold onto anything I eat, comes back up."
Man is that just spreading around? I got one on Christmas and it ended up being all of us just throwing up and diarrhea for days 
So you're Patient Zero? I'm coming to kick your ass as soon as mine stops spraying.

What a shitty thought 
When you have a caffeine addiction you don't need to think that far back.
"Is it all caffeine, or just coffee? Because I don't think that pop or energy drinks have the same effect on me. I definitely pee a lot more. But I think it's just coffee that makes me punish the porcelain. That and throwing in a chew. Why am I typing all this out. "
Some types of coffee makes me poop almost immediately. But not all.
"Hot drip coffee is like this for me. A single cup makes me poop like 4 times a day when I normally poop about once every other day. Therefore I tend to avoid it unless I need a good thorough clean out (which, granted, can be very satisfying if I have a free day for it)."
How do you know when you need to flush the pipe?
"Oh, you know.  "
"> Why am I typing all this out.

this last detail really made me chuckle"
"I drink 24-48 oz of coffee aday but it doesn't make me shit. Do I need to drink more coffee, I just shit at 5am every morning. "

Try drinking coffee. It works as a laxative for 30-40% of the population.
Funny I saw this because I just spent 30 minutes googling solutions before opening Reddit. I’m already chronically constipated but it’s real bad rn which sucks cos I’m on vacation and hate feeling so bloated. 
"going to be waiting for a while, want me to send a care package?"
"Make sure you use the door, they never open windows."
r/opiates is probably gonna win that one. 
Yeah... I'm on Oxycodone because I had my tonsils taken out. Haven't pooped in 7 days... I don't feel constipated though. I've been on mostly a liquid diet.
"I was on morphine (after breaking my leg and having surgery) for a week without any laxatives. I think it was 7-10 days before I pooped and it was horrible!!! At one point I couldn't push anymore and my butt tried sucking it back up. Had to break that shit off because I'd gone through so much trying to get it out. 

For my following surgery I was on oxy and made sure I was given laxatives. I did not want to go through that again. "
"Protip, press on your perineum/ taint region if you have a turtle popping out like that. Its similar to squeezing the edge of a pimple to force out the pus. Sounds gross and wierd, it is, but it works. Just kinda massage that taint. 

Source: certified uncle, assisted at least 1 constipated baby in making poo. "
"Ever since I was born, I could go several days without pooping. There were months where I could count on one hand how many times I popped, lol. I used to have really bad stomach aches due to it, but now it’s kinda like meh. I’ll poop eventually. My body is weird. Haha"
"Diet, hydration and exercise are the main factors typically. Your body likely isn’t that weird. "
"The same happened to me! I was pushing 2 weeks and no one ever told me I needed to tape stool softeners to help stay regular. I was super stoked when I finally had the urge to poop, but it was probably the worst one I’ve ever had. The worst part was it crawling back in when I stopped pushing. I really wish I had read about the poop knife before then"
"I’m on Oxycodone too! Except mine is because I got cancer last May, and it’s to help with the horrible pains of chemotherapy and radiation. The constipation is awful lol"
"Most laxatives don't work great when you have that issue, they are very rapid so you'll get all the stomach pain like you have diarrhea but you will still be blocked by a solid piece of stool holding everything in (horrible experience). The best option is to use magnesium citrate, get the bottled stuff from Walmart ($0.99 in cherry or lemon). It will work in about 12 hours and it kind of moistens your colon so it comes out smoothly. Don't over do it, only drink a quarter of the bottle and then another quarter if it hasn't worked after 12 hours. "
Oh I didn't know opiates would do that
"Former heroin addict. On suboxone now, can confirm. My ass bleeds almost every time I take a shit. 


Dont do drugs."
"Yeah, I'm a 12+ year heroin user, so I know all too well about the Arizona cans once every 10 days. I've gotten better the past 2 years of letting myself get sick enough to get it out before getting right. Lack of funds helps that too lol. "
Oh god after my leg surgery... It was titanic when it finally happened.
"Had jaw surgery and was on morphine for a couple days, also was on a liquid diet. I was given laxatives and was made to drink berry juice. Didn’t have a shit for three weeks. When I was finally able to bang one it was this disappointing little squiggle."
"I remember when I went to camp as a kid, I didn't poop the entire time. 1 full week. I didn't even know that was possible, but I just didn't have to go."
"Ive been there chief. Took a 9 day trip to NYC including travel time. Didnt poop once, ate three meals a day. Just didn't need to go. "
"Did you drop a 50lb log after getting home, or was it spread out over several quick shits in one day?"
"I didnt deuce for a day or two after I got back, then it was two of em like fat man & little boy. Then back to normal"
Respect.
Glad it worked out that way. Could have led to impacted stool. Not fun. I assume.
"It’s awful. I got impacted the last time I was pregnant. No one told me prenatal pills and pregnancy slowing your digestive system causes constipation and you should take something if you haven’t shit in a few days. I went a week, and had to be disimpacted."
Disimpacted?????
Someone gets to reach in you and get it out. Yes thats exactly what it sounds like.
"Doctor here. Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. It’s usually saved as a very very last resort (after enemas fail). Don’t worry, lots and lots of lube is used.

Fun fact: it’s the one of the things they “let” the medical student do. (More like force) Fortunately, I survived my medical training without having to do one. Probably because I have huge hands."
"Yeah. I’m a nurse. It’s a lot of fun for both nurse and patient. But the relief they feel is worth it (I guess if you’re a caring nurse, which I am)."
"I did this after having my baby.  Poop spoon upthread reminded me that I considered doing that.  Used my finger instead.  Picked away at some, and the pressure collapsed the poop onto itself until I pooped.  No fucking fun at all.  When picking at your poop is the best option you know you are fucked.  That was after the laxatives I finally asked for."
"Nurse here. I once had a patient who was so confused she literally couldn't tell us her own name.  I had to disimpact her, which I did as gently as I possible could have.  

She couldn't remember her name, but for DAYS, whenever anyone came into the room (including me,) she would say, ""Do you know what they DID to me?!?""  "
"I got constipated after giving birth. I was drinking about double what I normally do, but apparently being in the aircon 24/7 and breastfeeding meant that I was dehydrated, even though I was drinking about 3 litres of fluid a day. When one of the nurses asked me if I had ""moved my bowels"" since the birth I told her no ... it was 4 days since the birth. She looked alarmed and got me some laxatives. I went the next day and honest to God, it felt like I was giving birth again. Biggest poop I've ever dropped. "
Like fat man n little boy LMAO.... Jesus dude xD take my upvote already
Amateurs! I've done 14 days personal record. Would not recommend.
Wait youre telling me its not Normal to poop once every one or two weeks? Literally done that all my life
"There was that one chick that posted (I think in the beginning of the year) that hadn't pooped for like 2 weeks or something. Looked like she was pregnant.

It came to a tragic end in a Costco."
"A smart, frugal champion! It takes sheer will and power to control your digestive tract. Every calorie and sweet nutrient must be wrung out into your large intestine.

"Dude same... I poop once every week or two and I always thought it was normal

Is that really something I need to get checked out?"
"Looked it up and it seems like people are split between it being possibly a diet thing that should be remedied, or possibly just how your metabolism is if it's always been the norm for you.

I mean I do eat way too much junk food yet I'm still skinny and rather underweight for my size so I guess it's both
I have a mate like this. Poops every Thursday. And when he does.. his fam goes out for breakfast :)
"It sounds like you've got lazy bowel syndrome or IBS-C, but yes, get that checked by a professional because that's not normal (or healthy).

It might just be a case of getting some of the lighter laxatives like psyllium husk to naturally encourage your stools to move through your intestines a bit quicker."

">**PUSH**, but don't forget to breathe in ~~between~~ during pushes . he he ho ho

Holding your breath while pushing or exerting force increases intra thoracic pressure and vascular resistance making one prone to hemorrhoids.  Additionally, it's a great way to stimulate a vaso-vagal response slowing down the heart and lower blood pressure.  You could literally pass out from pooping if you strain. "
"Drink some water, eat some fiber, take a walk"

Big fucking mistake.

My cramps were so bad and I was *already halfway through my walk, how was I gonna get back without shitting myself?* So I staggered back home with the dog, and with each passing cramp pain I could feel the poop pushing through.

I barely got home before I sat on the toilet and my ass exploded."

A friend of mine left a 12-15 inch long shit that had to be at least 3 inches thick in a bowl years back. Literally ripped his asshole delivering it. About 6 of us were standing over the toilet in speedos perplexed by what we saw in front of us. Probably a solid 3 minutes of us just staring at shit before our coach broke our trance by asking us what the hell we were all doing.
"When I was a sophomore in high school, I decided to use the school bathroom.Normally, I would never do this for 2 reasons. 1, I hate using public bathrooms period. Unless I cleaned it, it's disgusting. 2, I've had bowel issues all my life where I wont be able to go for a week at  a time, sometimes longer (I've gotten much better with this in recent years.) Now, unfortunately, I had been 2 weeks since I had gone and my body decided the time to go was 11am on a Wednesday in the middle of class. I get a pass, head to restroom, and very quickly remove several pounds of trash from my body. But, here's the thing. As the poop was moving out, it stopped. I suddenly realized it had hit the bottom of the toilet but there was still poop connected IN ME. So I had to slowly stand up while STILL POOPING to finish. It came about two to three inches over the lid and was literally steaming. I freaked out, washed my hands and got out of the bathroom before anyone else showed up to see my child in the toilet. To this day, my largest shit, and one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. (Also, it wasn't thin. The width matched the length. Don't ask how I didn't need medical attention after that, cause i have no clue)"

I wonder how you get the taste of your own poop out of your mouth?
Gargle with your tears.
"I don't fully understand... wouldn't you just be throwing up normal vomit for the most part? I thought it doesn't actually become ""shit"" until the nutrients have been absorbed by the intestines. Wouldn't you just vomit anything you eat at some point, because it has nowhere to go (e.g. your at-capacity intestines)?"
"Just refreshed myself on the topic and found out why shit comes out

Fecal vomiting occurs when the bowel is obstructed for some reason, and intestinal contents cannot move normally. Peristaltic waves occur in an attempt to decompress the intestine, and the strong contractions of the intestinal muscles push the contents backwards through the pyloric sphincter into the stomach, where they are then vomited.[3]

Fecal vomiting can also occur in cats.[5]

Fecal vomiting does not include vomiting of the proximal small intestine contents, which commonly occurs during vomiting.[6]

It sounds like the shit from the large intestine is actually pushed backwards from contractions in an attempt to free stuff up but it ends up moving its way all the way to the stomach. It's apparently normal to have the stuff from your small intestine come out when you are doing normal everyday vomiting and it becomes fecal vomiting when the contents of the large intestine make their way to your stomach"
"I'm on methadone and normally I shit every 2 - 3 days pretty regularly as my dose has been the same for a few months, however the last week or two I've gone maybe once. Because of your comment I'm going to buy some laxatives tomorrow, I refuse to be throwing up shit lol."
"Get miralax or the generic version of it (you'll want the generic since it's cheaper) with propylene glycol as the active ingredient. It's not a stimulant laxative and instead works by drawing water into the intestine which will soften your poop. Because of this, you can take it daily without consequences unlike other laxatives which will cause your bowels to not function well without the drug and it is very safe. It might take a day or two after taking it to work, but if you take it daily your shit will become regular and will become the consistency of soft serve ice cream. You can shit a pound of shit in like 2 seconds when you take that stuff regularly because it comes out so easily lol.

 I used to be on methadone maintenance years ago, which is how I knew the shit vomit lady, and made a couple trips to the ER myself and had crap shoved up my butt there before I found miralax and never had a problem again. I have become a proponent for the stuff ever since. 

The main reason you get constipated on opiates is because your intestines relax on them and stop pushing as much (there's opiate receptors in them so they pretty much get high too in a way, it's also why opiates make people nauseous at first as that relaxation can cause nausea to those not used to it) and while your poop sits there your body is constantly drawing the water out of it until it's so hard that it can't really move. Propylene glycol fixes the root of the problem by forcing your body to push water back into them so your poop can soak it in and become soft again, so soft that it can freely move through them even with them being relaxed from the opiates"
"The more dangerous symptom is perforated intestines, which is caused by it not being able to hold it all so it bursts. That leaks the poison in the intestines to the outside of the intestines and you can die."

How anybody can sit two feet away from another human being while you're both shitting and be okay with it is beyond me. "
The one who poops loudest wins.
"Had a coworker that couldn’t poop in the stall if anyone else was in the bathroom.  He confided this in me.  One day, I decided since I make a nickel, boss makes a dime, I was gonna poop on company time.  Entered the bathroom, one stall occupied, nbd, I’ll just use the other.  As soon as I sit down I hear the other person get up to leave. I call my poop-shy friends name out softly followed by a few fake coughs to save myself from any potential awkwardness of it not being him.  He then calls my name out in return.  He ends up being comfortable enough to do his duty.  It was a beautiful moment.  Maybe I’ve found my calling?"

UUGHH
The old spicy twicey.
I now know my new favorite phrase for Thai. Thank you stranger 
God I love this site

Just like life huh"
"And to think that if I decided to start scrolling through reddit just 5 minutes earlier, I may never have read this absolute glorious phrase."

"I’ve enjoyed spicy food my whole life, but I never experience heat on the way out no matter the spiciness of the food. Is that normal or am I a no-spicy-on-the-way-out poop freak?"
"Is it all caffeine, or just coffee? Because I don't think that pop or energy drinks have the same effect on me. I definitely pee a lot more. But I think it's just coffee that makes me punish the porcelain. That and throwing in a chew. Why am I typing all this out. "
Some types of coffee makes me poop almost immediately. But not all.
"Hot drip coffee is like this for me. A single cup makes me poop like 4 times a day when I normally poop about once every other day. Therefore I tend to avoid it unless I need a good thorough clean out (which, granted, can be very satisfying if I have a free day for it)."
How do you know when you need to flush the pipe?
"Oh, you know.  "
"> Why am I typing all this out.

this last detail really made me chuckle"
"I drink 24-48 oz of coffee aday but it doesn't make me shit. Do I need to drink more coffee, I just shit at 5am every morning. "
Try a coffee enema
"Caffeine and hot liquids, if I drink caffeine free pop im fine but if I have a coke or redbull forget about it. Add some snus or juul hit and its game over"
i had diarrhea today
"Thank you for sharing, Semenpenis."
"Damn. The 7th, lucky you. 

I’m back in tomorrow. Im laying in bed now holding back tears and trying not to sleep yet because once I do then that’s it, up in the morning, back to work. "
"If you start a revolution and overthrow the government by next week, you'll be able to create a new national holiday so people can unwind a week after New Year's.

Yeah you are.

Did you mean Tabasco? I’m choking trying to swallow this tobacco. 
Both should work
Either one is gonna hurt on the way out 
Ive got a few bottles of tobacco. Should it be dried or fresh?
Same here. 😖 There's dozens of us!
It's fucking painful
Prunes? Natural laxative. A couple works wonders
no one wants to be a party pooper.
Water too! Also eat less meat. 
He's a Giants fan too so he *really* likes shitty products
Yeah... I'm on Oxycodone because I had my tonsils taken out. Haven't pooped in 7 days... I don't feel constipated though. I've been on mostly a liquid diet.
"I was on morphine (after breaking my leg and having surgery) for a week without any laxatives. I think it was 7-10 days before I pooped and it was horrible!!! At one point I couldn't push anymore and my butt tried sucking it back up. Had to break that shit off because I'd gone through so much trying to get it out. 

For my following surgery I was on oxy and made sure I was given laxatives. I did not want to go through that again. "
"Protip, press on your perineum/ taint region if you have a turtle popping out like that. Its similar to squeezing the edge of a pimple to force out the pus. Sounds gross and wierd, it is, but it works. Just kinda massage that taint. 

Source: certified uncle, assisted at least 1 constipated baby in making poo. "
"Ever since I was born, I could go several days without pooping. There were months where I could count on one hand how many times I popped, lol. I used to have really bad stomach aches due to it, but now it’s kinda like meh. I’ll poop eventually. My body is weird. Haha"
"Diet, hydration and exercise are the main factors typically. Your body likely isn’t that weird. "
"The same happened to me! I was pushing 2 weeks and no one ever told me I needed to tape stool softeners to help stay regular. I was super stoked when I finally had the urge to poop, but it was probably the worst one I’ve ever had. The worst part was it crawling back in when I stopped pushing. I really wish I had read about the poop knife before then"
"I’m on Oxycodone too! Except mine is because I got cancer last May, and it’s to help with the horrible pains of chemotherapy and radiation. The constipation is awful lol"
"Most laxatives don't work great when you have that issue, they are very rapid so you'll get all the stomach pain like you have diarrhea but you will still be blocked by a solid piece of stool holding everything in (horrible experience). The best option is to use magnesium citrate, get the bottled stuff from Walmart ($0.99 in cherry or lemon). It will work in about 12 hours and it kind of moistens your colon so it comes out smoothly. Don't over do it, only drink a quarter of the bottle and then another quarter if it hasn't worked after 12 hours. "
Oh I didn't know opiates would do that
"Former heroin addict. On suboxone now, can confirm. My ass bleeds almost every time I take a shit. 


Dont do drugs."
"Yeah, I'm a 12+ year heroin user, so I know all too well about the Arizona cans once every 10 days. I've gotten better the past 2 years of letting myself get sick enough to get it out before getting right. Lack of funds helps that too lol. "
Oh god after my leg surgery... It was titanic when it finally happened.
"Had jaw surgery and was on morphine for a couple days, also was on a liquid diet. I was given laxatives and was made to drink berry juice. Didn’t have a shit for three weeks. When I was finally able to bang one it was this disappointing little squiggle."
"Ive been there chief. Took a 9 day trip to NYC including travel time. Didnt poop once, ate three meals a day. Just didn't need to go. "
"Did you drop a 50lb log after getting home, or was it spread out over several quick shits in one day?"
"I didnt deuce for a day or two after I got back, then it was two of em like fat man & little boy. Then back to normal"
Respect.
Glad it worked out that way. Could have led to impacted stool. Not fun. I assume.
"It’s awful. I got impacted the last time I was pregnant. No one told me prenatal pills and pregnancy slowing your digestive system causes constipation and you should take something if you haven’t shit in a few days. I went a week, and had to be disimpacted."
Disimpacted?????
Someone gets to reach in you and get it out. Yes thats exactly what it sounds like.
"Doctor here. Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. It’s usually saved as a very very last resort (after enemas fail). Don’t worry, lots and lots of lube is used.

Fun fact: it’s the one of the things they “let” the medical student do. (More like force) Fortunately, I survived my medical training without having to do one. Probably because I have huge hands."
"Yeah. I’m a nurse. It’s a lot of fun for both nurse and patient. But the relief they feel is worth it (I guess if you’re a caring nurse, which I am)."
"I did this after having my baby.  Poop spoon upthread reminded me that I considered doing that.  Used my finger instead.  Picked away at some, and the pressure collapsed the poop onto itself until I pooped.  No fucking fun at all.  When picking at your poop is the best option you know you are fucked.  That was after the laxatives I finally asked for."
"Nurse here. I once had a patient who was so confused she literally couldn't tell us her own name.  I had to disimpact her, which I did as gently as I possible could have.  

She couldn't remember her name, but for DAYS, whenever anyone came into the room (including me,) she would say, ""Do you know what they DID to me?!?""  "
"I got constipated after giving birth. I was drinking about double what I normally do, but apparently being in the aircon 24/7 and breastfeeding meant that I was dehydrated, even though I was drinking about 3 litres of fluid a day. When one of the nurses asked me if I had ""moved my bowels"" since the birth I told her no ... it was 4 days since the birth. She looked alarmed and got me some laxatives. I went the next day and honest to God, it felt like I was giving birth again. Biggest poop I've ever dropped. "
Like fat man n little boy LMAO.... Jesus dude xD take my upvote already
Amateurs! I've done 14 days personal record. Would not recommend.
Wait youre telling me its not Normal to poop once every one or two weeks? Literally done that all my life
This guy is lost and missing. Someone send help.
"A smart, frugal champion! It takes sheer will and power to control your digestive tract. Every calorie and sweet nutrient must be wrung out into your large intestine. I am personally running at 98% currently. I poop every 2 months and it is so processed it has the consistency of a small handful of raisins."
"ITT: I learn that apparently pooping 3-4 times a month is not normal, and I should get this checked out.

Everyone talking about pooping like every other day is wild, guess I never really thought to compare with other people"
"Dude same... I poop once every week or two and I always thought it was normal

Is that really something I need to get checked out?"
"Looked it up and it seems like people are split between it being possibly a diet thing that should be remedied, or possibly just how your metabolism is if it's always been the norm for you.

Who knows, I'm gonna try eating healthier in 2019 though just in case"
I mean I do eat way too much junk food yet I'm still skinny and rather underweight for my size so I guess it's both
I have a mate like this. Poops every Thursday. And when he does.. his fam goes out for breakfast :)
"It sounds like you've got lazy bowel syndrome or IBS-C, but yes, get that checked by a professional because that's not normal (or healthy).

It might just be a case of getting some of the lighter laxatives like psyllium husk to naturally encourage your stools to move through your intestines a bit quicker."
"*I can be your hero, baby.*"
*I can kiss away the pain*
"Whoa, buy me dinner first before you kiss my ass."
*You can take my poop away*
Yes and you’re the first person to ever realize that without me telling!
"Well, it's an honor my good sir."
Glad I could be here to witness this wholesome moment.
But don't push too hard....hernias are a real thing.
hemorrhoids too
So is a rectal prolapse. Which I highly recommend you don't look up. :(
Rosebuds on the other hand are ok
">**PUSH**, but don't forget to breathe in ~~between~~ during pushes . he he ho ho

Holding your breath while pushing or exerting force increases intra thoracic pressure and vascular resistance making one prone to hemorrhoids.  Additionally, it's a great way to stimulate a vaso-vagal response slowing down the heart and lower blood pressure.  You could literally pass out from pooping if you strain. "
Go to an important meeting that you can't escape.
"I can confirm the walk thing. After eating a lot of fibre I took my dog for a walk.

Big fucking mistake.

My cramps were so bad and I was *already halfway through my walk, how was I gonna get back without shitting myself?* So I staggered back home with the dog, and with each passing cramp pain I could feel the poop pushing through.

I barely got home before I sat on the toilet and my ass exploded."
I am definitely a coffee pooper. I work nights so i haven't been up too long. Time to get cracking on making some butt brownies.
"> butt brownies.

There's something I wish I could erase from my memory. "
How about rectum rockets?
Just need to throw a giant fuck you to midnights in here.  I hate rarely seeing the sun.  
I work roughly 8pm-7am indoors and during the summer when the days are long I do the exact opposite. I'll go 5 days without seeing night time.
"How is it like being able to poop every day? 

i legit poop once  every 3 days "
"I shit at 5am every day, well 7am on weekends. Wake up contacts, shit, shower, coffee and swear at the morning."
"You put your contacts in before you shower? 
 What kind of animal are you."
I need to be able to see when I shower :(
Don’t forget the cigarette
And the sugar free Haribos
"Yea, forget about everything above.  Eat a few of these and start 2019 really shitty."
"Perhaps the biggest thing I miss about smoking was that grand morning ritual of coffee, smoke and a quick, easy shit."
Pretty incredible how well that combo works
And seven cans of Monster
Dont forget to drink the coffee too

"No, i drank last night. That why i am surprised i don't have the booze shits today. Then again i didn't get loaded either. Just comfortably buzzed."
Booze poos.
Different year! 
Imagine the people who were pooping in 1999 going into 2000. Transmillenial shitting.
"Imagine people who were pooping in 1 BC going into 1 AD. Trans era shitting, only gonna happen once."
Pretty sure Mary did this by accident
"Actually, that started in 2001, not 2k"
"I mean, yeah, technically you're correct, but I don't think the majority think of it that way, the change from the 1xxx years to 2xxx years is what people care about."

A friend of mine left a 12-15 inch long shit that had to be at least 3 inches thick in a bowl years back. Literally ripped his asshole delivering it. About 6 of us were standing over the toilet in speedos perplexed by what we saw in front of us. Probably a solid 3 minutes of us just staring at shit before our coach broke our trance by asking us what the hell we were all doing.
"When I was a sophomore in high school, I decided to use the school bathroom.Normally, I would never do this for 2 reasons. 1, I hate using public bathrooms period. Unless I cleaned it, it's disgusting. 2, I've had bowel issues all my life where I wont be able to go for a week at  a time, sometimes longer (I've gotten much better with this in recent years.) Now, unfortunately, I had been 2 weeks since I had gone and my body decided the time to go was 11am on a Wednesday in the middle of class. I get a pass, head to restroom, and very quickly remove several pounds of trash from my body. But, here's the thing. As the poop was moving out, it stopped. I suddenly realized it had hit the bottom of the toilet but there was still poop connected IN ME. So I had to slowly stand up while STILL POOPING to finish. It came about two to three inches over the lid and was literally steaming. I freaked out, washed my hands and got out of the bathroom before anyone else showed up to see my child in the toilet. To this day, my largest shit, and one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. (Also, it wasn't thin. The width matched the length. Don't ask how I didn't need medical attention after that, cause i have no clue)"
Did it get clogged
"Nope, wend down easy - left a load of skidmarks though."
Happy cake day

I didn't poop for over a week while traveling once for some reason. As soon as I got home I took the biggest shit of my life. 
"So am I to understand that all I actually need to do to achieve my entire 2019 weight-loss goal is acquire a butt plug \[check\] and mix a little cheeky laxative into a bottle of cherry Tango?

How did that feel when it crested the horizon? I just imagine a spine chilling orgasm as it all just coiled up like an chalky snake. 
It was a terrible experience which took a hour. However I did sleep for 16 hours after
"I work in medical records and once saw a patient's procedure listed as ""manual removal of fecal impaction"".

Never have I been so glad I'm not a doctor. It sounds like just reaching in their ass and pulling out the poo, but no way am I going to look it up to confirm."
Can confirm. It's long been a running joke that they make whoever doctor is lowest on the totem pole do the digital disimpactation. I almost had to do one but luckily (for me) we opted for surgery due to other concerns and ended up squeezing it out like a tube of toothpaste.
Gargle with your tears.
"Just refreshed myself on the topic and found out why shit comes out

Fecal vomiting occurs when the bowel is obstructed for some reason, and intestinal contents cannot move normally. Peristaltic waves occur in an attempt to decompress the intestine, and the strong contractions of the intestinal muscles push the contents backwards through the pyloric sphincter into the stomach, where they are then vomited.[3]

Fecal vomiting can also occur in cats.[5]

Fecal vomiting does not include vomiting of the proximal small intestine contents, which commonly occurs during vomiting.[6]

It sounds like the shit from the large intestine is actually pushed backwards from contractions in an attempt to free stuff up but it ends up moving its way all the way to the stomach. It's apparently normal to have the stuff from your small intestine come out when you are doing normal everyday vomiting and it becomes fecal vomiting when the contents of the large intestine make their way to your stomach"
"Get miralax or the generic version of it (you'll want the generic since it's cheaper) with propylene glycol as the active ingredient. It's not a stimulant laxative and instead works by drawing water into the intestine which will soften your poop. Because of this, you can take it daily without consequences unlike other laxatives which will cause your bowels to not function well without the drug and it is very safe. It might take a day or two after taking it to work, but if you take it daily your shit will become regular and will become the consistency of soft serve ice cream. You can shit a pound of shit in like 2 seconds when you take that stuff regularly because it comes out so easily lol.

 I used to be on methadone maintenance years ago, which is how I knew the shit vomit lady, and made a couple trips to the ER myself and had crap shoved up my butt there before I found miralax and never had a problem again. I have become a proponent for the stuff ever since. 

The main reason you get constipated on opiates is because your intestines relax on them and stop pushing as much (there's opiate receptors in them so they pretty much get high too in a way, it's also why opiates make people nauseous at first as that relaxation can cause nausea to those not used to it) and while your poop sits there your body is constantly drawing the water out of it until it's so hard that it can't really move. Propylene glycol fixes the root of the problem by forcing your body to push water back into them so your poop can soak it in and become soft again, so soft that it can freely move through them even with them being relaxed from the opiates"
Good to know im not the only one. I get poop anxiety as well especially at work!
Me too! And it always seems like nobody will be near the bathroom until I sit down for 'Ol Deucie...then they're having conversations 2 ft away on the other side of the door 😖
"You sound lucky enough to have a private bathroom.

My work bathroom is two stalls and a urinal and we share it with the entire floor. If I walk in there needing to poop and somebody is already in there, I just turn around and go back to work. I'll try again later.

How anybody can sit two feet away from another human being while you're both shitting and be okay with it is beyond me. "
The one who poops loudest wins.
"Had a coworker that couldn’t poop in the stall if anyone else was in the bathroom.  He confided this in me.  One day, I decided since I make a nickel, boss makes a dime, I was gonna poop on company time.  Entered the bathroom, one stall occupied, nbd, I’ll just use the other.  As soon as I sit down I hear the other person get up to leave. I call my poop-shy friends name out softly followed by a few fake coughs to save myself from any potential awkwardness of it not being him.  He then calls my name out in return.  He ends up being comfortable enough to do his duty.  It was a beautiful moment.  Maybe I’ve found my calling?"

"There's nothing worse than when it's coming out both ends, I've had actual food poisoning once and think I would rather die than deal with that again. "
That was me last night into today. Both ends violently. Lost ten pounds thought so I'm way ahead on my new years weight loss goals!
Haha.  I lost 5 and was thinking the exact same thing until I saw your 10.  Now I have a new 2020 resolution. 
Stay hydrated! Hope you feel better soon.
"Hey I’m not the only one!

Made it just past midnight, then got violently ill starting at about 1am. Actually spent a decent portion of the day in the ER getting 2 liters of fluids from an IV since I was so dehydrated. But hey, 2019 can only get better from here!"
"I've never been suicidal, and I'm not saying I *wanted* to die - but the last time I was so sick that it was coming out both ends **simultaneously**, I legitimately felt as though being dead would be/feel better than sitting on the toilet with my head over the bathtub Krakatoa-ing my guts everywhere."
I keep a plastic garbage bag under my bathroom sink just in case I have a both ends situation.  I can sit and poop while puking into the bag. It has saved me more than once!
I really hope you replace the bag.
Currently lying down after throwing up twice 🙋
"Food poisoning is a fucking nightmare. I just laid on the floor when I wasn’t shitting my brains out for a few days straight.

"Protip, press on your perineum/ taint region if you have a turtle popping out like that. Its similar to squeezing the edge of a pimple to force out the pus. Sounds gross and wierd, it is, but it works. Just kinda massage that taint.

"Ever since I was born, I could go several days without pooping. There were months where I could count on one hand how many times I popped, lol. I used to have really bad stomach aches due to it, but now it’s kinda like meh. I’ll poop eventually. My body is weird. Haha"
"Diet, hydration and exercise are the main factors typically. Your body likely isn’t that weird. "
"The same happened to me! I was pushing 2 weeks and no one ever told me I needed to tape stool softeners to help stay regular. I was super stoked when I finally had the urge to poop, but it was probably the worst one I’ve ever had. The worst part was it crawling back in when I stopped pushing. I really wish I had read about the poop knife before then"
"I’m on Oxycodone too! Except mine is because I got cancer last May, and it’s to help with the horrible pains of chemotherapy and radiation. The constipation is awful lol"
"Most laxatives don't work great when you have that issue, they are very rapid so you'll get all the stomach pain like you have diarrhea but you will still be blocked by a solid piece of stool holding everything in (horrible experience). The best option is to use magnesium citrate, get the bottled stuff from Walmart ($0.99 in cherry or lemon). It will work in about 12 hours and it kind of moistens your colon so it comes out smoothly. Don't over do it, only drink a quarter of the bottle and then another quarter if it hasn't worked after 12 hours. "
"Yeah, I'm a 12+ year heroin user, so I know all too well about the Arizona cans once every 10 days. I've gotten better the past 2 years of letting myself get sick enough to get it out before getting right. Lack of funds helps that too lol. "
"Did you drop a 50lb log after getting home, or was it spread out over several quick shits in one day?"
"I didnt deuce for a day or two after I got back, then it was two of em like fat man & little boy. Then back to normal"
Respect.
Glad it worked out that way. Could have led to impacted stool. Not fun. I assume.
"It’s awful. I got impacted the last time I was pregnant. No one told me prenatal pills and pregnancy slowing your digestive system causes constipation and you should take something if you haven’t shit in a few days. I went a week, and had to be disimpacted."
Disimpacted?????
Someone gets to reach in you and get it out. Yes thats exactly what it sounds like.
"Doctor here. Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. It’s usually saved as a very very last resort (after enemas fail). Don’t worry, lots and lots of lube is used.

Fun fact: it’s the one of the things they “let” the medical student do. (More like force) Fortunately, I survived my medical training without having to do one. Probably because I have huge hands."
"Yeah. I’m a nurse. It’s a lot of fun for both nurse and patient. But the relief they feel is worth it (I guess if you’re a caring nurse, which I am)."
"I did this after having my baby.  Poop spoon upthread reminded me that I considered doing that.  Used my finger instead.  Picked away at some, and the pressure collapsed the poop onto itself until I pooped.  No fucking fun at all.  When picking at your poop is the best option you know you are fucked.  That was after the laxatives I finally asked for."
"Nurse here. I once had a patient who was so confused she literally couldn't tell us her own name.  I had to disimpact her, which I did as gently as I possible could have.  

She couldn't remember her name, but for DAYS, whenever anyone came into the room (including me,) she would say, ""Do you know what they DID to me?!?""  "
"I got constipated after giving birth. I was drinking about double what I normally do, but apparently being in the aircon 24/7 and breastfeeding meant that I was dehydrated, even though I was drinking about 3 litres of fluid a day. When one of the nurses asked me if I had ""moved my bowels"" since the birth I told her no ... it was 4 days since the birth. She looked alarmed and got me some laxatives. I went the next day and honest to God, it felt like I was giving birth again. Biggest poop I've ever dropped. "
Like fat man n little boy LMAO.... Jesus dude xD take my upvote already
You were probably given opioids which would have made it pretty easy
"Dude same... I poop once every week or two and I always thought it was normal

Is that really something I need to get checked out?"
"Looked it up and it seems like people are split between it being possibly a diet thing that should be remedied, or possibly just how your metabolism is if it's always been the norm for you.

Who knows, I'm gonna try eating healthier in 2019 though just in case"
I mean I do eat way too much junk food yet I'm still skinny and rather underweight for my size so I guess it's both
I have a mate like this. Poops every Thursday. And when he does.. his fam goes out for breakfast :)
"It sounds like you've got lazy bowel syndrome or IBS-C, but yes, get that checked by a professional because that's not normal (or healthy).

It might just be a case of getting some of the lighter laxatives like psyllium husk to naturally encourage your stools to move through your intestines a bit quicker."
*I can kiss away the pain*
"Whoa, buy me dinner first before you kiss my ass."
*You can take my poop away*
"Well, it's an honor my good sir."

"... and that's why I took a poop, for the 16th time."
how does a double amputee know when to stop wiping?
Is this a joke to you!?
"When I was a sophomore in high school, I decided to use the school bathroom.Normally, I would never do this for 2 reasons. 1, I hate using public bathrooms period. Unless I cleaned it, it's disgusting. 2, I've had bowel issues all my life where I wont be able to go for a week at  a time, sometimes longer (I've gotten much better with this in recent years.) Now, unfortunately, I had been 2 weeks since I had gone and my body decided the time to go was 11am on a Wednesday in the middle of class. I get a pass, head to restroom, and very quickly remove several pounds of trash from my body. But, here's the thing. As the poop was moving out, it stopped. I suddenly realized it had hit the bottom of the toilet but there was still poop connected IN ME. So I had to slowly stand up while STILL POOPING to finish. It came about two to three inches over the lid and was literally steaming. I freaked out, washed my hands and got out of the bathroom before anyone else showed up to see my child in the toilet. To this day, my largest shit, and one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. (Also, it wasn't thin. The width matched the length. Don't ask how I didn't need medical attention after that, cause i have no clue)"
"Nope, wend down easy - left a load of skidmarks though."
Happy cake day
"Also, ""What the fuck is wrong with people? Is your life truly so empty that sitting on a frozen lake in a tent is considered a good time? I just wiped my diarrhea butt with my sister's panties."" in r/Minnesota lmfao. Glad I followed my curiosity.

"
Did you put the panties under her pillow afterwards?
Ask u/ButtholeLinoleum. I was quoting him lol
"""**There really is no greater joy than sitting on the toilet and shitting my fucking brains out.**"" Gee, I sure am glad i followed in jergin\_therlax's footsteps."

Not even Mr Slave?
"Hmm. That's a good question. Yeah but Mr. Slave was a pro. There was a lot of traffic back there. 

Shit (so to speak) now you're reminding me...what was the episode with Lemmiwinks?? Was that also Mr. Slave??"
Hot HOT HOT!
It was a terrible experience which took a hour. However I did sleep for 16 hours after
Can confirm. It's long been a running joke that they make whoever doctor is lowest on the totem pole do the digital disimpactation. I almost had to do one but luckily (for me) we opted for surgery due to other concerns and ended up squeezing it out like a tube of toothpaste.
Me too! And it always seems like nobody will be near the bathroom until I sit down for 'Ol Deucie...then they're having conversations 2 ft away on the other side of the door 😖
"You sound lucky enough to have a private bathroom.

My work bathroom is two stalls and a urinal and we share it with the entire floor. If I walk in there needing to poop and somebody is already in there, I just turn around and go back to work. I'll try again later.

How anybody can sit two feet away from another human being while you're both shitting and be okay with it is beyond me. "

That was me last night into today. Both ends violently. Lost ten pounds thought so I'm way ahead on my new years weight loss goals!
Haha.  I lost 5 and was thinking the exact same thing until I saw your 10.  Now I have a new 2020 resolution. 
Stay hydrated! Hope you feel better soon.
"Hey I’m not the only one!

Made it just past midnight, then got violently ill starting at about 1am. Actually spent a decent portion of the day in the ER getting 2 liters of fluids from an IV since I was so dehydrated. But hey, 2019 can only get better from here!"
"I've never been suicidal, and I'm not saying I *wanted* to die - but the last time I was so sick that it was coming out both ends **simultaneously**, I legitimately felt as though being dead would be/feel better than sitting on the toilet with my head over the bathtub Krakatoa-ing my guts everywhere."
I keep a plastic garbage bag under my bathroom sink just in case I have a both ends situation.  I can sit and poop while puking into the bag. It has saved me more than once!
I really hope you replace the bag.
Currently lying down after throwing up twice 🙋
"Food poisoning is a fucking nightmare. I just laid on the floor when I wasn’t shitting my brains out for a few days straight. You just get so angry and annoyed because it’s not a constant stream of hard cramps, but a periodic roller coaster. I couldn’t even just sit home and play video games or watch a show. "
Ugh. Our family caught Norovirus one year when it was going around. Everyone in the house was spewing from both ends. It was absolutely miserable.
It sucks when you don't know which end to put over the toilet

I was in the hospital for 6 days and pooped on the last day. I swear the diameter of that poop was the same as a basketball. My asshole ripped and I was bleeding and shitting at the same time. At first it was a couple of small chunks but then the flood gates burst and it felt like a cannon was launching shit out of my asshole.

When i finally told my parents and they took me to the doctor's,  he said I was days from dying.  I was transported to the clinical centre with an ambulance and emptied with the procedure.  Apparently my guts were 100% full. 2 full toilets of crap.  The guy who did the procedure,  said:"" Now it's the time to take your life into your hands so we don't meet each other again. "" It's been 14 years,  and I'm keeping my shit together. "
"Well done for keeping your shit together! I was 18, I should have my shit together by then."
I mean I do eat way too much junk food yet I'm still skinny and rather underweight for my size so I guess it's both
Rosebuds on the other hand are ok
I need to be able to see when I shower :(
If the deluge was good enough for God its good enough for my asshole

Pretty sure Mary did this by accident
"I mean, yeah, technically you're correct, but I don't think the majority think of it that way, the change from the 1xxx years to 2xxx years is what people care about."
Ask u/ButtholeLinoleum. I was quoting him lol
"""**There really is no greater joy than sitting on the toilet and shitting my fucking brains out.**"" Gee, I sure am glad i followed in jergin\_therlax's footsteps."
You're in the turd trimester 
Not even Mr Slave?
"Hmm. That's a good question. Yeah but Mr. Slave was a pro. There was a lot of traffic back there. 

Shit (so to speak) now you're reminding me...what was the episode with Lemmiwinks?? Was that also Mr. Slave??"
The one who poops loudest wins.
"Trust me, sprog is gonna get a nice book deal out of this once he/she gives up the pen name. "
Glad I’m not the only one
Yesss i heard it immediatly
there's a shitflix deal being made right now
This is the turd time i've heard this joke
These puns are abowelminable.
Not from the stool where I sit
Well they do have breathable butts
Did you just assume that they're not a sea pig?
"Here a sort of liquid cough, tuberculoshits if you will"
"😂 this needs to be the 2019 way of saying “I’m going to take a dump”, instead we say, “I need to go log out”. Fucking millenials. "
oof

This is why I Reddit. Good job dudes.
"SOME OF THOSE WHO POOPED FORCED IT, WERE THE SAME WITH LEGS CROSSED YEAH"
BY CHECKING THE PLY TO SEE IT'S WHITE
SOMETHING SPICY AND FRIED
"Oh, you know.  "
"I'm not your partner, fella"
"I’m not your fella, guy "
Since it's still inside I would recommend a poop spoon.  You have less chance of damaging your poop hole.
Or just a shop vac. Go hard or go home.
You’re just one shop vac accident away from anal prolapse.
"I saw a video once where this... no, never mind."
Who said it was an accident? 
Aren't we all!
*dyson intensifies*
Baby boomers prefer Hoover's...
I bet those fancy Japanese bidet toilets have some sort of attachment like that.
Just use the suction from a turkey baster
What would a poop fork be good for?
For eating a poop steak with poop knife of course!
"It’s awful. I got impacted the last time I was pregnant. No one told me prenatal pills and pregnancy slowing your digestive system causes constipation and you should take something if you haven’t shit in a few days. I went a week, and had to be disimpacted."
Disimpacted?????
Someone gets to reach in you and get it out. Yes thats exactly what it sounds like.
"Doctor here. Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. It’s usually saved as a very very last resort (after enemas fail). Don’t worry, lots and lots of lube is used.

Fun fact: it’s the one of the things they “let” the medical student do. (More like force) Fortunately, I survived my medical training without having to do one. Probably because I have huge hands."
"Yeah. I’m a nurse. It’s a lot of fun for both nurse and patient. But the relief they feel is worth it (I guess if you’re a caring nurse, which I am)."
"I did this after having my baby.  Poop spoon upthread reminded me that I considered doing that.  Used my finger instead.  Picked away at some, and the pressure collapsed the poop onto itself until I pooped.  No fucking fun at all.  When picking at your poop is the best option you know you are fucked.  That was after the laxatives I finally asked for."
"Nurse here. I once had a patient who was so confused she literally couldn't tell us her own name.  I had to disimpact her, which I did as gently as I possible could have.  

She couldn't remember her name, but for DAYS, whenever anyone came into the room (including me,) she would say, ""Do you know what they DID to me?!?""  "
"I got constipated after giving birth. I was drinking about double what I normally do, but apparently being in the aircon 24/7 and breastfeeding meant that I was dehydrated, even though I was drinking about 3 litres of fluid a day. When one of the nurses asked me if I had ""moved my bowels"" since the birth I told her no ... it was 4 days since the birth. She looked alarmed and got me some laxatives. I went the next day and honest to God, it felt like I was giving birth again. Biggest poop I've ever dropped. "
Eat. Pray. Shit.
"Wait I thought people prayed, ate, and then pooped. So many different cultures on Reddit!"

"The Mouse in the Manor House is the name of the book, Sam Garland is her name. I really hope someday we can get somebody to compile all of the Reddit poems into one big delicious collection
