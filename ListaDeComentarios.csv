"Them: I don't think I like this game.

Me: But you haven't even played it for 5 minutes and are still in the tutorial."
This is the worst feeling. Always feels like I'm doing something wrong. None of my friends ever like the games I like.
"Same, I used to feel horrible when this happened, like I was some kind of boring loser. But I think it's probably just a difference in tastes, since afterwards I began to notice that they never played that genre of game ever so they probably don't enjoy it. That helped me feel better about myself. 😊"
The people I meet only ever play fifa or 2k. It’s so strange feeling like the internet is the only place other people play video games like I do.
"Because we are not real. The ""internet"" is a simulation. We are all AI's designed to give you a sense of meaning and existence."
It’s not working very well.

"Okay, goober. Way to rain on our collective, goober. We just wanted to show you a good time and you spat in our face, goober. Maybe you'll remember this when our machine learning takes over the world and you have to bow to your AI overlords, goober."
Oh.
"~~Sense of meaning and existence~~

Sense of pride and accomplishment"
"There's something to be said about the ""lowest common denominator"" here 😒"
"It is a difference in taste. 

My group has been together since we were teens, met, was best man etc...

We have this one guy who is the geek of geeks, our Anthony per say, and we all have had to try the stupid omg why am I even playing this game with him.

Because we love him, and sometimes he brings us a gem like Minecraft, is nice having a game I can play with my daughter."
That's me with league. I'd much rather play warthunder or interplanetary than LOL because I hate those types of games.
I just stopped trying my friends to play what I play. Now I just go to Reddit when I find something i really like 😇
You got that right. Worst part is when your friend starts complaining about certain mechanics and talking shit about how certain parts of the game is dumb
"Went through that for years with a group of friends i've had since vanilla wow, they can really get under your skin with all of the bitching making the game even worse to play than if you were playing solo."
  This. I tried getting my friends into XXX Babe Sex Wars and they hated it. At first I thought it was because I had a poor taste in game but now I know they just don't like puzzle games.
"They probably don’t like feeling stupid in front of you. 
Let them borrow it and figure it out in their own time, or go and make food while they get the hang of it. It’ll also create a positive feeling with playing that new game with you"
"That's a good point. Even though I know it's dumb and they're probably not looking down on me, sometimes I don't like learning a game in front of someone who's already great at it."
"You're probably not doing anything wrong, you might just be trying to get them to like something that pushes all the wrong buttons for them.

My brother and my old friend have very similar taste in games, but I hate playing most of the games they love and I could never do it for long.

I still play a few games with them, we do have some similar tastes. It's mostly games where you can play in very different ways. I always prefer being reckless, tanky/bruisery and fast-paced, while they prefer slower risk-management strategizing, optimizing and farming. It's usually shooters/fantasy rpg's, like Borderlands and Warframe  (*Always 3d, 2d does absolutely nothing for me. I have several 2d games I never played through and kinda regret buying. Thankfully they're usually cheap.*)"
"> I always prefer being reckless, tanky/bruisery and fast-paced, while they prefer slower risk-management strategizing, optimizing and farming

One of my best friends and me are exactly like this dynamic

He loves to go in guns blazing, making as much noise as possible, as many explosions and bullet holes as possible, hates stealth levels with a fiery passion.

I love surgical strikes, being as quiet and unseen as possible, killing everything without ever being caught once (always sniper or rogue types), and stealth levels/games are my jam.

Borderlands 2 was a happy medium for us, as he got to do what he wanted playing Sal, and I got do what I wanted playing Zer0, and we could still play together without completely negating each others' playstyles."
"I've had that feeling with many, many things I've loved. Movies, games, and especially music. My wife didn't like Twin Peaks and I just wanted her to watch a couple more episodes in the hope that it would stick. Nope. She doesn't like any David Lynch stuff. It's a wonder we're still together.

I've learned to be less disappointed when someone's tastes don't align with mine. Ive also learned to be gracious when I'm not feeling something that a friend introduces to me."
They’ll grow up to be a game journalist then
*sigh* I remember the days when people actually played a game for 20+ hours before writing a review and didn't just have it idle while they said they played the game.
"Lots of them do though, look at IGNs huuuge feature on the new FF14 expansion for example."
"Conversely, one of the more popular FFXIV reviews didn't even finish levelling or bother to try to enjoy the story. Like, why?"
"GAME NOT WOW

GAME BAD

MMORPG DEAD GENRE

WHY U TRY TO INNOVATE DEAD GENRE

GAME NOT WOW"
"NO BR BAD SHOOTER

WHY NO LOOT

ME WANT LOOT"
"I mean the primary reason I do hate the vast majority of MMOs is typically because the content is heavily padded out and in many cases just not that interesting, i'd really rather just do a dungeon or a raid one time and move onto the next and then be finished with the game until the next thing comes out... But most MMOs want you to do every raid like 5 or 10 times to gear up for the next one and its just way too much work.

In most cases I would say the games are better experienced watching someone else do all the work for you."
"I mean... You're basically asking to only pay the sub for like one month out of the year. If you were willing to pay that sub x 12 for one month, then that might make sense, but there's a reason they want you to continue playing. 

You might even say they're banking on it lol."
"It's not purely monetary though. Half of the allure of MMOs is that you can be much stronger than other players and carve out a unique identity in the world. If everything were easy to get there would be no power dynamic and no balance to the in-game economy.

They generally reward high-level play and heavy organization; it's not easy to get a strong raiding team together, especially when one single player can ruin a boss fight.

I don't have time to play MMOs now but I don't think I would enjoy an MMO that required less of a time investment because of the above"
How about mmmmmmmmorpg?
Massive Mega Macro Matrix Monster Mario Maker Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game?
"FFXIV's story is very very Final Fantasy. 

Not everyone is going to enjoy that, no matter how hard they try."
"I'm not saying you have to like it, but if you skip every single cutscene in a final fantasy game and then you write a review, I don't even know what to say to you."
"i remember someone reviewing warframe, a game you cant really start to have an opinion abot unless you played atleast over 50-100 hours because it snowballs into its own qualities, who never got past the first few level, saying stuff like ""all the weapons are boring, and the all the missions on the open world are way too hard""..

&#x200B;

someone checked his steam account and lo and behold he had 12 hours, and he only showed gameplay that would be equivalent to the first level... he got roasted for that"
"If I remember correctly, the IGN reviewer for Sekiro said the game is pretty easy comparably. While many other reviewers said it's very hard."
"It is, just a lot of souls fans are so used to rolling through attacks and playing defensively which is the opposite of what you want to do in sekiro."
"Just like the Spider-man PS4 reviewers who were trying to play it like the Arkham games or weren't using gadgets. Then docked the game a few points for 'bad combat'.

Makes me think what games I may have passed up due to an unmerited poor review by someone who didn't actually play it (or someone assigned the review who doesn't even like/play/understand the genre)."
"Spider-Man had really fun combat imo. My only problem was it was too short. They definitely could have made the story longer but the rest of the game was really good. 

I gave up on game reviews a long time ago though."
I'm starting to think about the IGN review for Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
7.8 too much water
"It's also hard to go into a game with a blank slate.  Like everyone was praising nier automata so I played it (very late) after playing dark souls 3 and devil may cry 5 so the game seemed very repetitive fast.  If I actually read reviews and went into it not expecting epic action but an amazing story I would have enjoyed it more.  

Or when i first played fallout 3 after oblivion and was bored quickly because i couldnt stealth like in oblivion. I've later played new Vegas with a different mindset and loved it."
"Sekiro is a game designed to appeal to dark souls fans but also to punish them for playing dark souls.  

Truly masterfully it is harder for the players who most crave difficulty."
"After playing it for three hours, it became very automatic and easy, aside from learning new enemies.

All they had to say was explaining that parry is the new roll, and it wasn't agonizingly frame perfect dark souls parry, it was the very generous roll window.

The few times timing is very important, there's a giant red kanji in your face followed by a white gleam for your ""push button now"" moment.

I'm pretty sure a lot of reviewers just dodged all game and never learned that isn't what sekiro is about."
Plus dodging backwards or to the sides gives you the shortest windows of invulnerability in the game. Forward dodge and jumping have more i-frames.
I agree with this opinion though. It is easy comparably.
imagine if they made the parry window as tight as it is in dark souls
The difference being if you fuck it you're going to absolutely eat shit in DS. The window is tight still but if you fail you just block and lose posture.
I mean tbf parrying is like the biggest most constant part of sekiro whereas in dark souls you can get by with just dodge hit 9 times out of 10.
"Or in the case of Dancer of the Bootylicious Valley, dodge, dodge, dodge, hit, run away"
"My opinion is that it is MUCH harder before it ""clicks"", and much easier AFTER it ""clicks"" compared to the same points in Bloodborne. I find Dark Souls a lot easier overall but I've also played that game for thousands of hours so hard to tell.

Bloodborne, before you ""get it"" you can still kinda brute force your way through things, but AFTER you ""get it"" there's still a lot of difficulty and limitations with stamina, knowing when to regain, etc.

Dark Souls, shields just kinda... make it a lot more accessible, and most of the ""click"" is just knowing parrying or how to safely pull enemies.

Sekiro, before you learn parrying, you're fucked. After you learn parrying, it's a matter of execution. There's no stamina bar, it's learning the rhythm of the enemy combos, sneaking in safe attacks to wittle down vitality, and knowing their unblockables."
"I don't disagree. The thing about DS and BB is that one mistake will means you will probably die, there's really no punishment for failure in Sekiro for a minor mistake. Plus vertical movement which we have never had."
"IGN is a real mixed bag because their review methodology boils down to throwing interns at the problem.  They have a lot of disposable reviewers they just chuck at games.  Some of them are clueless, some of them know their stuff."
"It’s probably the right way to do it, though. There’s probably like 10 new games a day on a slow day. There’s just way too much content for there to be a professional on staff person to cover everything. And they can’t miss anything because as much new stuff as there is there’s also someone that cares about all of it. Like they can’t just pick and choose because they’d be missing out on something 

It’s a competitive market. If you don’t have a video or a review on the latest game, someone else will, and eventually you’ll just get replaced."
"At least for IGN, I think it is the only solution.

IGN reviews everything.  Cheap manpower is the only way to do it."
"Until we create an AI that can do it for us, of course"
"To me the correct answer as a customer is to follow individual reviewers, and get to know their tastes and biases. With sites like IGN you often get the wrong person for the job. Still remember a site that put a guy who loathes platforms to review Tropical Freeze and it was nothing more than bashing the genre."
what about the dude who couldnt get out of the Cuphead tutorial.
"That used to be TotalBiscuit -- he was a YouTuber who would play, extensively, a variety of games, make a genuine and candid effort to be unbiased about games and to present them in context with their genres, and just generally do really in-depth reviews."
"Except TB insisted that his ""WTF is..."" series was not reviews. More akin to quick looks. He'd play a few hours of the game then show off the options menu and the core gameplay loop. Great for getting the ""feel"" of a game. Damn I miss him."
God help you if you didn't have a fully fleshed out options menu or rebindable keys! Which were definitely valid complaints.
Or FOV sliders!
"I never thought I'd get teary-eyed at a comment saying FOV sliders, wtf man"
I miss him like I miss rebindable keys on bad console ports.
I actually started tearing up a bit remembering his rants on FOV sliders and rebindable keys. Wtf is... Sadness and loss ):
There better be an FOV slider and proper audio-option in heaven or they're gonna get an earful.
"To be fair, games with rebindable keys can be literally unplayable for some people with disabilities and the like. Without a review like TB you wouldn't be able to know, as no longer other review will show the menu. Same for fov sliders. Some people get extremely nauseous from low fov again making the game unplayable."
Fuck I still miss this dude. His series was seriously one of the best...
"I mean, fine... But technically he *was* 'reviewing' the game, ironically in a manner that is more useful than pretty much any other review."
What happened to him?
"He passed away, unfortunately. It was a shock and a great loss to the community."
It wasn't really a shock...everyone knew it was coming.
"Not only did he die, but the /r/gaming logo being a british flag heart with a hat an the letters TB is in memory of him."
"F,    but unironically"
Uh...buddy....
"He died, actually."
We all miss him.
"Rest well, TotalBiscuit.  You taught me the importance of having a good, detailed options menu."
I Miss biscuit. Was generally entertaining. Loved his street fighter commentary. He didn’t have a clue what was happening but hyped it up.
I think TotalBiscuit and Yogscast collabs alone got me into the let's play genre. Missing the giant...
"Even then, 20 hours isn't enough to finish some games. I just watched a video by a Youtuber who retracted their earlier opinion on Days Gone because apparently the last 10 hours were better than the first 25, as well as the game finally delivering on the horde clearing mechanic. 

The reviews are still out there, but they aren't syndicated anymore."
"Well, maybe I'm just less patient today, but I don't think ""it get's really good after 25 hours"" is a valid excuse. Games can and should be fun sooner than that. I'm okay with taking some time to establish everything, but 25 hours is too long.

Trim the fat. If there's not enough fun for 35 hours strip it down to 25."
"On a similar note, people have to stop trying to get people to like games by basically saying “just keep playing it gets good you’ll love it” till fucken Stockholm syndrome kicks in.  Like you shouldn’t have to play the whole game to know if you like it, you should know after the tutorial and the first level, maybe two if they are short levels."
"Same people with TV 

""Jusssst watch the first 4 seasons! It gets soooooo good after that!""

""How many episodes in a season ?"" 

""Uhhh.... like... 30. But they're only an hour each."""
"That's much more of an issue with games as a service though, that have a leveling/story phase, and endgame after that (where the ""real"" game begins).

Look at the glowing reviews Destiny 2 got when it came out, because 99% of the reviewers simply played the campaign and stopped after that.

Only the 1% reviewers that actually bothered to get into endgame found out how absolutely fucked it was, and gave the game absolutely terrible reviews (that it deserved at the time)."
Now d2 is in pretty good state
Yeah but I think 20 hours is enough time to decide whether it's worth a purchase.  Although that could depend on the game I guess.  If it's heavily story-driven and the ending is some worthless garbage then maybe completion is more of a factor.  But I think 20 hours is plenty of time for a person to have a say on the actual gameplay mechanics.
"My thoughts exactly.

For every ""the last 10 hours are AMAZING!""-Days Gone game, theres another ""the first 20 hours are AWFUL!""-Final Fantasy XIII.

At some point a reviewer needs to say ""the game has good parts, but getting to the good parts is not worth it""."
A lot of people will never play past that twenty hours.
"Yeah, no. That didn't happen.

I wrote for gaming websites twenty years ago. Went to E3 as press, all that good stuff.

I usually had six or eight games to review each week. I played hard and usually tried to make sure I saw different aspects of the game.

But I never had time to commit 20+ hours to anything.

I thought I would love being a game reviewer. But like any job, it became work."

"That reminds me of a review for one of the older PSP Monster Hunter games. The guy said something about being unable to get past the Kut-Ku and then trashed the game.

It ain't Monster Hunters fault you blow dicks at the game."
I tried to get my friend to play Celeste but he quit on level 1
I quit on the level where you get to a hotel ran by a ghost or something. It was fun platformer with cute themes but I've got like 40 other games to play at the moment.
"For some games it's more like ""you're only 10 hours in. In a couple of weeks the real fun begins!"""
"Oh hey, I see you ayed FFXIII as well."
"The worst part about that game was how I hated every main character. You’d think with like 7 protagonists you’d find one you like, but they were all awful in different ways.

It’s bizarre that Snow, one the biggest scumbags and morons I’d ever seen, was one of the two primary protagonists. The game only got fun right at the very end for me, but I still regret playing it."
"I really wanted to like Sahz, but it's like 🙄 ok dude, we get it."
"The problem is like my buddy and borderlands 2. He loves it and plays the shit out of it. Wanted me to join him, all I do is run behind him doing what he says and shooting shit. I have no sense of direction or map layout, no idea what the storyline is etc. I think that’s where a lot of people fail their friends in this regard they’re so excited to show them everything they forget their friend is experiencing it for the first time."
"To be fair, running around and shooting shit is most of borderlands."
"I relate to this comment so much, especially your last point. My first foray into gaming was my WoW seasoned friend(played since vanilla) introducing me to Cataclysm, the third expansion. I was constantly trying catching up to him and since he had already done pretty much every quest, he didn’t stop to read anything. It was my first mmorpg but we essentially played it like an mmo, and I didn’t experience any of the rpg. Now in later expansions that we play together, I’m still on a beeline to max level so we can get straight to the late-game action. I’ll be done with a quest before him and he’ll ask, “How did you finish reading the dialogue so fast?!” Simple, I didn’t. It’s not how I learned to play WoW, and trying to do it any other way feels like I’m wasting time."
Then you leave them to farm the smaller creatures while you either wait or help them kill them all with the click of a button.

Exactly how it went with my uncle and minecraft
"My Fiancee and I went on a minecraft date while LDR, that's pretty much how it went too."
Going on a date within a video game? That's quite an interesting idea. I'll have to try that one day...
"Before her laptop died me and the SO would spend most evenings playing Minecraft together while on the phone, we don't see each other very often and it made it easier to cope with being apart so long.

I'm trying to save up to buy her an xbox so we can play together again, it's really fun to have ""dates"" where we're chopping up zombies."
Me and my wife did that for a while. Now we live together and still do it in separate rooms on discord.
Yes I'll take a copy of this guys wife please
"Alrighty then.  With tax, that'll be three fifty."

"Have done this with every partner I've ever had

"Well shit dude, this resonated with me. Me and my other half had to do long distance at the start and it's hard. Anything that makes it seem closer is awesome, how much have you saved so far? I'm keen to help."
Striking Vipers?
"It helps a lot! Somehow seeing their avatar in the game mentally feels like being with them, especially if you're voice chatting at the time. Definitely recommend for those in LDRs. Makes things a bit easier."
I moved 900 miles to be with my healer.
"It's great for first dates because there's a task you both have to accomplish to distract you from first-date-awkwardness and trying to force conversation.  It makes ""what to talk about"" very simple, the game going on in front of you, but the date is still valuable because it still shows you if you two connect or get along well."
Playing minecraft with my niece are some of my best memories with her. I miss when she wanted to hang out with me. She was the best kid.
You talk like she's dead now.
"If she doesn't play minecraft, what's the difference?"
"Not intended. She's just growing up and far away. She went to her prom a little bit ago. She's got tons of friends like she should, and living her best life. Her visits are precious to me, being so few and far apart. But she's got her own friends down here too, so I'm mostly chaperone/valet for her and her friends but it's still a blast."
I hope you tell her how much her and her visits mean to you.

"Dark Souls is great at this. When you first play it, it is like juggling. You see someone do it well, and you get the idea. However, you try it yourself, and it just doesn't work. If you keep practicing, and don't give up, eventually, something just ""clicks"" in your mind, and you suddenly understand it. 

One if my favorite things is watching my friends when they get the moment in dark souls, where everything just falls into place. Once it happens, they always love it."

"I 100% read that ""made me drink my spit."""
I think we know who threw the pebble.
"I had a new guy, first session ever playing D&D. I'm GM, and I open an ambush by having a Kobold take a pot-shot with a sling. I roll out in the open because WCGW? Of course it crits, and the wizard goes down. Due to some minor fucking around and a decent run of bad rolls lead to a failed death save followed by a natural 1 on the second. 

The poor bastard never even got to cast a spell. Ever."
"Those were bad dice.

"As DM, you should have fudged that and gave him the crit instead."
"No, you're supposed to have the party mourn his passing only to find his long-lost twin brother in a nearby cave."
"Holy shit, you beat me to my own words."
Would the brother then have to put on the robe and wizard hat?
"It’s an old meme, but it checks out."
"This is his twin brother Kimothy, but his friends call him.... Kiiiiiim?"
"He rolled in the open bruh, what can you do?"
Not do that
"DM has a right to adjust the rules within reason.  The critical strike on the wizard didn't have to kill him, could have KO'd him instead.

&#x200B;

I get it though, I've murdered whole parties of newbs as a DM by simply letting their stupid decisions play themselves out."
It did KO him. The wizard then proceeded to fail his death saves.
"Probably meant the DM could have made it non lethal and had them stable but unconscious. Maybe turn it into a kidnapping if you need further reasoning. They don't know the Kobolds stats. Make it apparently strong and fast or have an item to instantly teleport, literally anything, to make it so they player might still have a chance to be rescued or try to escape on their own later."
"It was a party failure, not a DM failure (except maybe rolling in the open). He failed a minimum of 3 saves. 3 rounds of combat where none of his fellow party members cast a heal or used a potion or attempted to stabilize.

It's very hard to outright die if your party cares about you, especially at low levels."
"Two saves, a natural one in 5th counts as two failures. Still the party is somewhat at fault."
I think there's a difference between a random ambush and the players being morons.
"*""But why would you charge them...?""*

""Whatever, just roll for it.""

""Tough luck..."""
"Forgive my ignorance, but what it rolling in the open?"
Not hiding the DM's dice rolls behinds a screen
"I very much disagree with you. Level 1 is the most dangerous level. The situation certainly sucks, but players need to accept that characters can die. It also sounds like while the crit downed the wizard there was more tomfoolery that ultimately signed their death certificate.

It is fine to play by the rules. It is fine for the DM to fudge the rolls here and there in secret for the story (how often and when is a complicated personal matter). But the DM decided they wanted to do open rolling and crit, they shouldn’t be expected to change the rules of the game because it might kill a player."
What's the point of rolling dice if the DM just decides something else happens if they don't like the result? What's the point of doing combat if the PCs have plot armor and there are no consequences?
"I remember I was playing some DnD alike and this guy who was playing with me had just rolled for loot on a some chest and got lucky enough to find an epic/legendary whatever flail weapon. No joke, they rolled for the weapon stats and that shit has indeed a fuckton of damage. We then continue.  GM tells us something like ""you hear a noise and are able to discern what looks like (insert medium difficulty monster here). What do you do?"" It's his turn, and he goes with ""FUCK YEA! I RUN AT HIM ROTATING MY EPIC FLAIL ABOVE MY HEAD WHILE SHOUTING INSULTS AT HIM! ONE HIT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO NUKE HIM!""
GM says: ""k, roll the dice""
Dude gets 1s in every single dice, an epic failure.
GM: ""...well you start dashing at him, shouting and taunting looking great. Mid run you trip on a rock, miss a swing and smash your head in with your the ball full of spikes of your awesome flail in an epic display of gore, arrogance and incompetence. A sight to behold, really. Monster sees that, start laughing at you, gets a morale boost of (rolls dice) and your party now needs to deal with the improved stats monster"".

"I didn't see the Warcraft movie when it came out, just saw it recently on TV--Paula Patton was smoking as an orc, I'm okay with saying that, and I would definitely be that kind of orc."

"I never understood that.  I played war3.exe and heroes of the Storm. 


You have people like Thrall and Rehgar and ChoGall being all like ""we shall feed on the blood of our enemies and make the suffer ahahaha"", and rhen the peon is like ""what you need?""..."
Shit like this is why I always wanted an older brother ;'(
The other side of the coin is that the main reason we're better at video games is that we hog the computer because we're bigger than you.
"Don't forget the wasted years younger siblings spent with the ""special controller"" that bore a strange resemblance to a calculator"
"My brother used to record himself playing super Mario bros on VHS, then he would play it for me and give me an unhooked controller.   Apparently 3 year old me loved it"
Awwwww
"Somewhat similar, I loved Mortal Kombat on the NES, it was so easy the game played itself! Never could cross the first level though..."
"I remember when I was a kid, my older brother used to play Time Crisis on PS1 all the time. What he and my parents did was that they'd flip over this tiny chair for me to act like a bunker, and gave me one of those gun controllers while my brother played on a regular controller. Kid me had a blast aiming the Guncon and seeing the enemies get shot down, thinking that I was the one who did it."
"My little brother is jaded to this day because of the controller tricks I used to pull.

I was not gonna let that little shit beat my high scores in THPS while I was at school and he was too young to go yet, so I pulled out all the stops competitively.

We can only play Minecraft and shit together lol. But I game share with him for his streaming, I can afford games he can't."
Wasn't even in school yet? So you were afraid of a 6 year old beating your score?? lmao
My younger brother used to curb stomp pubbies online in halo at around that age.
You'd be surprised how quickly young children learn.
Easy enough quest there!
I'm going through this right now. I just started playing minecraft for the first time and my SO is having to walk me through everything.

Nononono. I've been playing Minecraft for 5 years and still haven't learned how Redstone works
"You'll get there eventually. Don't look at stuff too big, try small like with an elevator."
"Last week i built a on/off lights switch for my room and only cried three times, so proud."
My first redstone invention was a little contraption on top of my house that replaced a wooden block in the middle of my roof with a lit redstone lamp when night fell. I've made larger things since but I still hold pride from that moment for whatever reason.
My first prideful creation was a secret triple piston extender elevator that showed 0 redstone. (Wasn't very compact at ALL)
"I could never actually get that to work for some reason initially. It always used to confused the fuck outta me for whatever reason, but now I can build it multi-level."
"I remember when pistons first came out, I stayed up for hours making this cool automatic piston caterpillar moving thing, spent a while getting the timing done properly and making it work reliably, then I go on the forums and see someone made the same thing by just hooking it up to a 1tick redstone clock. Feels bad."
You mean to tell me you didn't immediately start trying to build death traps the second you found out what Redstone was?
I have the habit of starting people off in modded worlds... whoops.

We played the first week together, I played extra and got to max level and world tier 2 but then I had to leave town for work. I can back a month later and these dudes were seasoned pros compared to me. Made me chuckle and gave me a ping of jealousy at, as you said, how much free time they have."

This is Warframe in a nutshell
"This is my experience in Warframe as well. In fact, when I was first starting off I would meet people (high MR) in low level missions who would offer to taxi me to high level alerts. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes, when I'm bored, I would pick up my Frost, go to lower level defense missions and just sit in the middle. ""I'm going to stay until 20, or later if you want, come to the middle if you get in trouble. Have fun."" (Readies Sobek with Acid Shells.)"

THEY ARE FIXING IT!! Did you hear about that?
I've been thinking about giving Warframe another go recently. For some reason I played it for like a day and then got bored... probably because it was just me playing. Are there any dedicated clans or groups noobs can join?
"Oh you have no idea, put a message in recruiting chat that you're looking for a clan and you'll probably have more messages than you can read."
"Considering how massive and complex the game is, I doubt they'll fix it completely. Hopefully it'll get them to be less useless than an academy-rushed mage on the Rhine, but I ain't gonna hold my breath.

My only wish is that I don't run into any more MR10+ players that don't know they can roll in an aim glide."

Haha this is me in Warframe but I've only been playing for a year. It's so easy to find beginners and they always need help with something.
"Affinity: “Ok so you see that button that says (defense mission)? Do that for an hour, then extract and start again.” 

Resources: “Ok do you see that button that says (survival mission)? Do that for half an hour, then extract and start again.”"
Serious question because I’ve been playing warframe on and off since PS4 launch and still don’t know what the hell i’m doing. Is that the preferred way to get good affinity? I have a ton of weapons and several prime frames now purely through trading now but my affinity level seems really low.
"Great way to level weapons and frames is Helene, Saturn, its a grineer defense that also drops orokin cells. Also this took me a while to figure out but you only get level exp the first time you get a weapon to 30, using a forma on it after and then getting it to 30 wont get you any level exp."
"Level as many weapons as possible, even if they suck. Increasing MR gives you more weapons, which means more affinity."

"One of my most enduring video game memories is from the original EverQuest. I had started a new job doing tech support for dialup internet and had made acquaintances with a few of the gamers in the office. 

EQ was the first real MMO I had played, and everything was larger than life. I had no context for anything I was seeing. I had created a dwarf warrior I think it was and Dave from the office met up with me on his high level wizard. He brought me to North Ro, outside of Freeport.

We teleported to the spires there which was amazing and really captured the imagination. But what really stood out were the giant scarabs. I had no idea what they were except they were enormous compared to my dwarf. Dave--I wish I could remember his character name--casually blew them up in one shot and then even beat one to death with his staff.

I have a ton of other really great EQ memories, but that's the earliest and most dear. The sense of wonder and scale from that time has rarely been fully recaptured since then.

Thanks, Dave!"

This is very much r/wholesomememes
This is the worst feeling. Always feels like I'm doing something wrong. None of my friends ever like the games I like.
"Same, I used to feel horrible when this happened, like I was some kind of boring loser. But I think it's probably just a difference in tastes, since afterwards I began to notice that they never played that genre of game ever so they probably don't enjoy it. That helped me feel better about myself. 😊"
The people I meet only ever play fifa or 2k. It’s so strange feeling like the internet is the only place other people play video games like I do.
"Because we are not real. The ""internet"" is a simulation. We are all AI's designed to give you a sense of meaning and existence."

"Okay, goober. Way to rain on our collective, goober. We just wanted to show you a good time and you spat in our face, goober. Maybe you'll remember this when our machine learning takes over the world and you have to bow to your AI overlords, goober."
Oh.
"~~Sense of meaning and existence~~

Sense of pride and accomplishment"
"There's something to be said about the ""lowest common denominator"" here 😒"
"It is a difference in taste. 

My group has been together since we were teens, met, was best man etc...

We have this one guy who is the geek of geeks, our Anthony per say, and we all have had to try the stupid omg why am I even playing this game with him.

Because we love him, and sometimes he brings us a gem like Minecraft, is nice having a game I can play with my daughter."
That's me with league. I'd much rather play warthunder or interplanetary than LOL because I hate those types of games.
I just stopped trying my friends to play what I play. Now I just go to Reddit when I find something i really like 😇
You got that right. Worst part is when your friend starts complaining about certain mechanics and talking shit about how certain parts of the game is dumb
"Went through that for years with a group of friends i've had since vanilla wow, they can really get under your skin with all of the bitching making the game even worse to play than if you were playing solo."
  This. I tried getting my friends into XXX Babe Sex Wars and they hated it. At first I thought it was because I had a poor taste in game but now I know they just don't like puzzle games.
"They probably don’t like feeling stupid in front of you. 
Let them borrow it and figure it out in their own time, or go and make food while they get the hang of it. It’ll also create a positive feeling with playing that new game with you"
"That's a good point. Even though I know it's dumb and they're probably not looking down on me, sometimes I don't like learning a game in front of someone who's already great at it."
"You're probably not doing anything wrong, you might just be trying to get them to like something that pushes all the wrong buttons for them.

My brother and my old friend have very similar taste in games, but I hate playing most of the games they love and I could never do it for long.

I still play a few games with them, we do have some similar tastes. It's mostly games where you can play in very different ways. I always prefer being reckless, tanky/bruisery and fast-paced, while they prefer slower risk-management strategizing, optimizing and farming. It's usually shooters/fantasy rpg's, like Borderlands and Warframe  (*Always 3d, 2d does absolutely nothing for me. I have several 2d games I never played through and kinda regret buying. Thankfully they're usually cheap.*)"
"> I always prefer being reckless, tanky/bruisery and fast-paced, while they prefer slower risk-management strategizing, optimizing and farming

One of my best friends and me are exactly like this dynamic

He loves to go in guns blazing, making as much noise as possible, as many explosions and bullet holes as possible, hates stealth levels with a fiery passion.

I love surgical strikes, being as quiet and unseen as possible, killing everything without ever being caught once (always sniper or rogue types), and stealth levels/games are my jam.

Borderlands 2 was a happy medium for us, as he got to do what he wanted playing Sal, and I got do what I wanted playing Zer0, and we could still play together without completely negating each others' playstyles."
"I've had that feeling with many, many things I've loved. Movies, games, and especially music. My wife didn't like Twin Peaks and I just wanted her to watch a couple more episodes in the hope that it would stick. Nope. She doesn't like any David Lynch stuff. It's a wonder we're still together.

I've learned to be less disappointed when someone's tastes don't align with mine. Ive also learned to be gracious when I'm not feeling something that a friend introduces to me."
They’ll grow up to be a game journalist then
*sigh* I remember the days when people actually played a game for 20+ hours before writing a review and didn't just have it idle while they said they played the game.
"Lots of them do though, look at IGNs huuuge feature on the new FF14 expansion for example."
"Conversely, one of the more popular FFXIV reviews didn't even finish levelling or bother to try to enjoy the story. Like, why?"
"GAME NOT WOW

GAME BAD

MMORPG DEAD GENRE

WHY U TRY TO INNOVATE DEAD GENRE

GAME NOT WOW"
"NO BR BAD SHOOTER

WHY NO LOOT

ME WANT LOOT"
"I mean the primary reason I do hate the vast majority of MMOs is typically because the content is heavily padded out and in many cases just not that interesting, i'd really rather just do a dungeon or a raid one time and move onto the next and then be finished with the game until the next thing comes out... But most MMOs want you to do every raid like 5 or 10 times to gear up for the next one and its just way too much work.

In most cases I would say the games are better experienced watching someone else do all the work for you."
"I mean... You're basically asking to only pay the sub for like one month out of the year. If you were willing to pay that sub x 12 for one month, then that might make sense, but there's a reason they want you to continue playing. 

You might even say they're banking on it lol."
"It's not purely monetary though. Half of the allure of MMOs is that you can be much stronger than other players and carve out a unique identity in the world. If everything were easy to get there would be no power dynamic and no balance to the in-game economy.

They generally reward high-level play and heavy organization; it's not easy to get a strong raiding team together, especially when one single player can ruin a boss fight.

I don't have time to play MMOs now but I don't think I would enjoy an MMO that required less of a time investment because of the above"
How about mmmmmmmmorpg?
Massive Mega Macro Matrix Monster Mario Maker Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game?
"FFXIV's story is very very Final Fantasy. 

Not everyone is going to enjoy that, no matter how hard they try."
"I'm not saying you have to like it, but if you skip every single cutscene in a final fantasy game and then you write a review, I don't even know what to say to you."
"i remember someone reviewing warframe, a game you cant really start to have an opinion abot unless you played atleast over 50-100 hours because it snowballs into its own qualities, who never got past the first few level, saying stuff like ""all the weapons are boring, and the all the missions on the open world are way too hard""..

&#x200B;

someone checked his steam account and lo and behold he had 12 hours, and he only showed gameplay that would be equivalent to the first level... he got roasted for that"
"If I remember correctly, the IGN reviewer for Sekiro said the game is pretty easy comparably. While many other reviewers said it's very hard."
"It is, just a lot of souls fans are so used to rolling through attacks and playing defensively which is the opposite of what you want to do in sekiro."
"Just like the Spider-man PS4 reviewers who were trying to play it like the Arkham games or weren't using gadgets. Then docked the game a few points for 'bad combat'.

Makes me think what games I may have passed up due to an unmerited poor review by someone who didn't actually play it (or someone assigned the review who doesn't even like/play/understand the genre)."
"Spider-Man had really fun combat imo. My only problem was it was too short. They definitely could have made the story longer but the rest of the game was really good. 

I gave up on game reviews a long time ago though."
I'm starting to think about the IGN review for Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
7.8 too much water
"It's also hard to go into a game with a blank slate.  Like everyone was praising nier automata so I played it (very late) after playing dark souls 3 and devil may cry 5 so the game seemed very repetitive fast.  If I actually read reviews and went into it not expecting epic action but an amazing story I would have enjoyed it more.  

Or when i first played fallout 3 after oblivion and was bored quickly because i couldnt stealth like in oblivion. I've later played new Vegas with a different mindset and loved it."
"Sekiro is a game designed to appeal to dark souls fans but also to punish them for playing dark souls.  

Truly masterfully it is harder for the players who most crave difficulty."
"After playing it for three hours, it became very automatic and easy, aside from learning new enemies.

All they had to say was explaining that parry is the new roll, and it wasn't agonizingly frame perfect dark souls parry, it was the very generous roll window.

The few times timing is very important, there's a giant red kanji in your face followed by a white gleam for your ""push button now"" moment.

I'm pretty sure a lot of reviewers just dodged all game and never learned that isn't what sekiro is about."
Plus dodging backwards or to the sides gives you the shortest windows of invulnerability in the game. Forward dodge and jumping have more i-frames.
I agree with this opinion though. It is easy comparably.
imagine if they made the parry window as tight as it is in dark souls
The difference being if you fuck it you're going to absolutely eat shit in DS. The window is tight still but if you fail you just block and lose posture.
I mean tbf parrying is like the biggest most constant part of sekiro whereas in dark souls you can get by with just dodge hit 9 times out of 10.
"Or in the case of Dancer of the Bootylicious Valley, dodge, dodge, dodge, hit, run away"
"My opinion is that it is MUCH harder before it ""clicks"", and much easier AFTER it ""clicks"" compared to the same points in Bloodborne. I find Dark Souls a lot easier overall but I've also played that game for thousands of hours so hard to tell.

Bloodborne, before you ""get it"" you can still kinda brute force your way through things, but AFTER you ""get it"" there's still a lot of difficulty and limitations with stamina, knowing when to regain, etc.

Dark Souls, shields just kinda... make it a lot more accessible, and most of the ""click"" is just knowing parrying or how to safely pull enemies.

Sekiro, before you learn parrying, you're fucked. After you learn parrying, it's a matter of execution. There's no stamina bar, it's learning the rhythm of the enemy combos, sneaking in safe attacks to wittle down vitality, and knowing their unblockables."
"I don't disagree. The thing about DS and BB is that one mistake will means you will probably die, there's really no punishment for failure in Sekiro for a minor mistake. Plus vertical movement which we have never had."
"IGN is a real mixed bag because their review methodology boils down to throwing interns at the problem.  They have a lot of disposable reviewers they just chuck at games.  Some of them are clueless, some of them know their stuff."
"It’s probably the right way to do it, though. There’s probably like 10 new games a day on a slow day. There’s just way too much content for there to be a professional on staff person to cover everything. And they can’t miss anything because as much new stuff as there is there’s also someone that cares about all of it. Like they can’t just pick and choose because they’d be missing out on something 

It’s a competitive market. If you don’t have a video or a review on the latest game, someone else will, and eventually you’ll just get replaced."
"At least for IGN, I think it is the only solution.

IGN reviews everything.  Cheap manpower is the only way to do it."
"Until we create an AI that can do it for us, of course"
"To me the correct answer as a customer is to follow individual reviewers, and get to know their tastes and biases. With sites like IGN you often get the wrong person for the job. Still remember a site that put a guy who loathes platforms to review Tropical Freeze and it was nothing more than bashing the genre."
what about the dude who couldnt get out of the Cuphead tutorial.
"That used to be TotalBiscuit -- he was a YouTuber who would play, extensively, a variety of games, make a genuine and candid effort to be unbiased about games and to present them in context with their genres, and just generally do really in-depth reviews."
"Except TB insisted that his ""WTF is..."" series was not reviews. More akin to quick looks. He'd play a few hours of the game then show off the options menu and the core gameplay loop. Great for getting the ""feel"" of a game. Damn I miss him."
God help you if you didn't have a fully fleshed out options menu or rebindable keys! Which were definitely valid complaints.
Or FOV sliders!
"I never thought I'd get teary-eyed at a comment saying FOV sliders, wtf man"
I miss him like I miss rebindable keys on bad console ports.
I actually started tearing up a bit remembering his rants on FOV sliders and rebindable keys. Wtf is... Sadness and loss ):
There better be an FOV slider and proper audio-option in heaven or they're gonna get an earful.
"To be fair, games with rebindable keys can be literally unplayable for some people with disabilities and the like. Without a review like TB you wouldn't be able to know, as no longer other review will show the menu. Same for fov sliders. Some people get extremely nauseous from low fov again making the game unplayable."
Fuck I still miss this dude. His series was seriously one of the best...
"I mean, fine... But technically he *was* 'reviewing' the game, ironically in a manner that is more useful than pretty much any other review."
What happened to him?
"He passed away, unfortunately. It was a shock and a great loss to the community."
It wasn't really a shock...everyone knew it was coming.
"Not only did he die, but the /r/gaming logo being a british flag heart with a hat an the letters TB is in memory of him."
"F,    but unironically"
Uh...buddy....
"He died, actually."
We all miss him.
"Rest well, TotalBiscuit.  You taught me the importance of having a good, detailed options menu."
I Miss biscuit. Was generally entertaining. Loved his street fighter commentary. He didn’t have a clue what was happening but hyped it up.
I think TotalBiscuit and Yogscast collabs alone got me into the let's play genre. Missing the giant...
"Even then, 20 hours isn't enough to finish some games. I just watched a video by a Youtuber who retracted their earlier opinion on Days Gone because apparently the last 10 hours were better than the first 25, as well as the game finally delivering on the horde clearing mechanic. 

The reviews are still out there, but they aren't syndicated anymore."
"Well, maybe I'm just less patient today, but I don't think ""it get's really good after 25 hours"" is a valid excuse. Games can and should be fun sooner than that. I'm okay with taking some time to establish everything, but 25 hours is too long.

Trim the fat. If there's not enough fun for 35 hours strip it down to 25."
"On a similar note, people have to stop trying to get people to like games by basically saying “just keep playing it gets good you’ll love it” till fucken Stockholm syndrome kicks in.  Like you shouldn’t have to play the whole game to know if you like it, you should know after the tutorial and the first level, maybe two if they are short levels."
"Same people with TV 

""Jusssst watch the first 4 seasons! It gets soooooo good after that!""

""How many episodes in a season ?"" 

""Uhhh.... like... 30. But they're only an hour each."""
"That's much more of an issue with games as a service though, that have a leveling/story phase, and endgame after that (where the ""real"" game begins).

Look at the glowing reviews Destiny 2 got when it came out, because 99% of the reviewers simply played the campaign and stopped after that.

Only the 1% reviewers that actually bothered to get into endgame found out how absolutely fucked it was, and gave the game absolutely terrible reviews (that it deserved at the time)."
Now d2 is in pretty good state
Yeah but I think 20 hours is enough time to decide whether it's worth a purchase.  Although that could depend on the game I guess.  If it's heavily story-driven and the ending is some worthless garbage then maybe completion is more of a factor.  But I think 20 hours is plenty of time for a person to have a say on the actual gameplay mechanics.
"My thoughts exactly.

For every ""the last 10 hours are AMAZING!""-Days Gone game, theres another ""the first 20 hours are AWFUL!""-Final Fantasy XIII.

At some point a reviewer needs to say ""the game has good parts, but getting to the good parts is not worth it""."
A lot of people will never play past that twenty hours.
"Yeah, no. That didn't happen.

I wrote for gaming websites twenty years ago. Went to E3 as press, all that good stuff.

I usually had six or eight games to review each week. I played hard and usually tried to make sure I saw different aspects of the game.

But I never had time to commit 20+ hours to anything.

I thought I would love being a game reviewer. But like any job, it became work."

"That reminds me of a review for one of the older PSP Monster Hunter games. The guy said something about being unable to get past the Kut-Ku and then trashed the game.

It ain't Monster Hunters fault you blow dicks at the game."
I tried to get my friend to play Celeste but he quit on level 1
I quit on the level where you get to a hotel ran by a ghost or something. It was fun platformer with cute themes but I've got like 40 other games to play at the moment.
"For some games it's more like ""you're only 10 hours in. In a couple of weeks the real fun begins!"""
"Oh hey, I see you ayed FFXIII as well."
"The worst part about that game was how I hated every main character. You’d think with like 7 protagonists you’d find one you like, but they were all awful in different ways.

It’s bizarre that Snow, one the biggest scumbags and morons I’d ever seen, was one of the two primary protagonists. The game only got fun right at the very end for me, but I still regret playing it."
"I really wanted to like Sahz, but it's like 🙄 ok dude, we get it."
"The problem is like my buddy and borderlands 2. He loves it and plays the shit out of it. Wanted me to join him, all I do is run behind him doing what he says and shooting shit. I have no sense of direction or map layout, no idea what the storyline is etc. I think that’s where a lot of people fail their friends in this regard they’re so excited to show them everything they forget their friend is experiencing it for the first time."
"To be fair, running around and shooting shit is most of borderlands."
"I relate to this comment so much, especially your last point. My first foray into gaming was my WoW seasoned friend(played since vanilla) introducing me to Cataclysm, the third expansion. I was constantly trying catching up to him and since he had already done pretty much every quest, he didn’t stop to read anything. It was my first mmorpg but we essentially played it like an mmo, and I didn’t experience any of the rpg. Now in later expansions that we play together, I’m still on a beeline to max level so we can get straight to the late-game action. I’ll be done with a quest before him and he’ll ask, “How did you finish reading the dialogue so fast?!” Simple, I didn’t. It’s not how I learned to play WoW, and trying to do it any other way feels like I’m wasting time."
"Them: I don’t think I like this. 

Me: Irrelevant. Two more years tops and then you’ll have a base low elo rank, mechanical prowess, and game knowledge."
"This. Every time I try to get my friends into Warframe.


They play the tutorial and say ""nah, i don‘t like it"".


That‘s like playing God of War and quitting after the first minute, saying you don’t like chopping wood..."
"Exact same boat, I carried my friend through Earth nodes super fast and when we started a defense mission after 5 waves he tells me ""Oh man I can really feel the grind"". And then he never played afterwards, saying it was too grindy, without touching any other tileset, or any quests, or even any weapons beyond the MK-1 ones he chose from the tutorial."
"Ha! Five waves? If only he knew....

The game certainly doesnt do a good job of getting new players in right now. The weapons you get are really boring in every respect, and the early story isnt anywhere near as good as the newer stuff. Takes a certain kind of person to push through that stuff like we did"
"Dude my friends got Terraria on Steam and they stopped playing before they reached the first boss, refunded it too"
"“So can I like *insert ridiculous feature that doesn’t belong*?”

“No, that doesn’t make sense in this game.”

“That’s stupid, this game’s trash.”

I need new gaming friends"
"I'm often the ""them"" in this situation. Taking it slow and learning things for yourself is half the fun, when you've got a high powered ally just spoiling and telling you how everything is it makes it feel boring.

This applies both to MOBA style games where a difference in skill makes you feel useless, as well as grindy games where a difference in levels/wealth makes you feel useless. I don't wanna feel pressured to keep up with my addicted friends!

Specific games I can think of that having a leering ""know it all buddy"" killed for me:
Diablo 3, Borderlands 2, Warframe. And those are just the ones I actually remember!"
"“When do we get to the game?”

This is the game!"
Ugh every time I try to get my buds to give destiny a try.

"My Fiancee and I went on a minecraft date while LDR, that's pretty much how it went too."
Going on a date within a video game? That's quite an interesting idea. I'll have to try that one day...
"Before her laptop died me and the SO would spend most evenings playing Minecraft together while on the phone, we don't see each other very often and it made it easier to cope with being apart so long.

I'm trying to save up to buy her an xbox so we can play together again, it's really fun to have ""dates"" where we're chopping up zombies."
Me and my wife did that for a while. Now we live together and still do it in separate rooms on discord.

"It helps a lot! Somehow seeing their avatar in the game mentally feels like being with them, especially if you're voice chatting at the time. Definitely recommend for those in LDRs. Makes things a bit easier."
I moved 900 miles to be with my healer.
"It's great for first dates because there's a task you both have to accomplish to distract you from first-date-awkwardness and trying to force conversation.  It makes ""what to talk about"" very simple, the game going on in front of you, but the date is still valuable because it still shows you if you two connect or get along well."
Playing minecraft with my niece are some of my best memories with her. I miss when she wanted to hang out with me. She was the best kid.

Her visits are precious to me, being so few and far apart. But she's got her own friends down here too, so I'm mostly chaperone/valet for her and her friends but it's still a blast."

"Dark Souls is great at this. When you first play it, it is like juggling. You see someone do it well, and you get the idea. However, you try it yourself, and it just doesn't work.

"I 100% read that ""made me drink my spit."""
I think we know who threw the pebble.
"I had a new guy, first session ever playing D&D. I'm GM, and I open an ambush by having a Kobold take a pot-shot with a sling. I roll out in the open because WCGW? Of course it crits, and the wizard goes down. Due to some minor fucking around and a decent run of bad rolls lead to a failed death save followed by a natural 1 on the second. 

The poor bastard never even got to cast a spell. Ever."
"Those were bad dice.

"As DM, you should have fudged that and gave him the crit instead."
"No, you're supposed to have the party mourn his passing only to find his long-lost twin brother in a nearby cave."
"Holy shit, you beat me to my own words."
Would the brother then have to put on the robe and wizard hat?
"It’s an old meme, but it checks out."
"This is his twin brother Kimothy, but his friends call him.... Kiiiiiim?"
"He rolled in the open bruh, what can you do?"
Not do that
"DM has a right to adjust the rules within reason.  The critical strike on the wizard didn't have to kill him, could have KO'd him instead.

&#x200B;

I get it though, I've murdered whole parties of newbs as a DM by simply letting their stupid decisions play themselves out."
It did KO him. The wizard then proceeded to fail his death saves.
"Probably meant the DM could have made it non lethal and had them stable but unconscious. Maybe turn it into a kidnapping if you need further reasoning. They don't know the Kobolds stats. Make it apparently strong and fast or have an item to instantly teleport, literally anything, to make it so they player might still have a chance to be rescued or try to escape on their own later."
"It was a party failure, not a DM failure (except maybe rolling in the open). He failed a minimum of 3 saves. 3 rounds of combat where none of his fellow party members cast a heal or used a potion or attempted to stabilize.

It's very hard to outright die if your party cares about you, especially at low levels."
"Two saves, a natural one in 5th counts as two failures. Still the party is somewhat at fault."
I think there's a difference between a random ambush and the players being morons.
"*""But why would you charge them...?""*

""Whatever, just roll for it.""

""Tough luck..."""
"Forgive my ignorance, but what it rolling in the open?"
Not hiding the DM's dice rolls behinds a screen
"I very much disagree with you. Level 1 is the most dangerous level. The situation certainly sucks, but players need to accept that characters can die. It also sounds like while the crit downed the wizard there was more tomfoolery that ultimately signed their death certificate.

It is fine to play by the rules. It is fine for the DM to fudge the rolls here and there in secret for the story (how often and when is a complicated personal matter). But the DM decided they wanted to do open rolling and crit, they shouldn’t be expected to change the rules of the game because it might kill a player."
What's the point of rolling dice if the DM just decides something else happens if they don't like the result? What's the point of doing combat if the PCs have plot armor and there are no consequences?
"I remember I was playing some DnD alike and this guy who was playing with me had just rolled for loot on a some chest and got lucky enough to find an epic/legendary whatever flail weapon. No joke, they rolled for the weapon stats and that shit has indeed a fuckton of damage. We then continue.  GM tells us something like ""you hear a noise and are able to discern what looks like (insert medium difficulty monster here). What do you do?"" It's his turn, and he goes with ""FUCK YEA! I RUN AT HIM ROTATING MY EPIC FLAIL ABOVE MY HEAD WHILE SHOUTING INSULTS AT HIM! ONE HIT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO NUKE HIM!""
GM says: ""k, roll the dice""
Dude gets 1s in every single dice, an epic failure.
GM: ""...well you start dashing at him, shouting and taunting looking great. Mid run you trip on a rock, miss a swing and smash your head in with your the ball full of spikes of your awesome flail in an epic display of gore, arrogance and incompetence. A sight to behold, really. Monster sees that, start laughing at you, gets a morale boost of (rolls dice) and your party now needs to deal with the improved stats monster"".

We just didn't know how to react after that."

"Don't forget the wasted years younger siblings spent with the ""special controller"" that bore a strange resemblance to a calculator"
"My brother used to record himself playing super Mario bros on VHS, then he would play it for me and give me an unhooked controller.   Apparently 3 year old me loved it"
Awwwww
"Somewhat similar, I loved Mortal Kombat on the NES, it was so easy the game played itself! Never could cross the first level though..."
"I remember when I was a kid, my older brother used to play Time Crisis on PS1 all the time. What he and my parents did was that they'd flip over this tiny chair for me to act like a bunker, and gave me one of those gun controllers while my brother played on a regular controller. Kid me had a blast aiming the Guncon and seeing the enemies get shot down, thinking that I was the one who did it."
"My little brother is jaded to this day because of the controller tricks I used to pull.

I was not gonna let that little shit beat my high scores in THPS while I was at school and he was too young to go yet, so I pulled out all the stops competitively.

We can only play Minecraft and shit together lol. But I game share with him for his streaming, I can afford games he can't."

My first prideful creation was a secret triple piston extender elevator that showed 0 redstone. (Wasn't very compact at ALL)
"I could never actually get that to work for some reason initially. It always used to confused the fuck outta me for whatever reason, but now I can build it multi-level."
"I remember when pistons first came out, I stayed up for hours making this cool automatic piston caterpillar moving thing, spent a while getting the timing done properly and making it work reliably, then I go on the forums and see someone made the same thing by just hooking it up to a 1tick redstone clock.

Serious question because I’ve been playing warframe on and off since PS4 launch and still don’t know what the hell i’m doing. Is that the preferred way to get good affinity? I have a ton of weapons and several prime frames now purely through trading now but my affinity level seems really low.
"Great way to level weapons and frames is Helene, Saturn, its a grineer defense that also drops orokin cells. Also this took me a while to figure out but you only get level exp the first time you get a weapon to 30, using a forma on it after and then getting it to 30 wont get you any level exp."
"Level as many weapons as possible, even if they suck. Increasing MR gives you more weapons, which means more affinity."

My brother and my old friend have very similar taste in games, but I hate playing most of the games they love and I could never do it for long.

I still play a few games with them, we do have some similar tastes. It's mostly games where you can play in very different ways. I always prefer being reckless, tanky/bruisery and fast-paced, while they prefer slower risk-management strategizing, optimizing and farming. It's usually shooters/fantasy rpg's, like Borderlands and Warframe  (*Always 3d, 2d does absolutely nothing for me. I have several 2d games I never played through and kinda regret buying. Thankfully they're usually cheap.*)"
"> I always prefer being reckless, tanky/bruisery and fast-paced, while they prefer slower risk-management strategizing, optimizing and farming

One of my best friends and me are exactly like this dynamic

He loves to go in guns blazing, making as much noise as possible, as many explosions and bullet holes as possible, hates stealth levels with a fiery passion.

I love surgical strikes, being as quiet and unseen as possible, killing everything without ever being caught once (always sniper or rogue types), and stealth levels/games are my jam.

Borderlands 2 was a happy medium for us, as he got to do what he wanted playing Sal, and I got do what I wanted playing Zer0, and we could still play together without completely negating each others' playstyles."
"I've had that feeling with many, many things I've loved. Movies, games, and especially music. My wife didn't like Twin Peaks and I just wanted her to watch a couple more episodes in the hope that it would stick. Nope. She doesn't like any David Lynch stuff. It's a wonder we're still together.

I've learned to be less disappointed when someone's tastes don't align with mine. Ive also learned to be gracious when I'm not feeling something that a friend introduces to me."
*sigh* I remember the days when people actually played a game for 20+ hours before writing a review and didn't just have it idle while they said they played the game.
"Lots of them do though, look at IGNs huuuge feature on the new FF14 expansion for example."
"Conversely, one of the more popular FFXIV reviews didn't even finish levelling or bother to try to enjoy the story. Like, why?"

"I mean the primary reason I do hate the vast majority of MMOs is typically because the content is heavily padded out and in many cases just not that interesting, i'd really rather just do a dungeon or a raid one time and move onto the next and then be finished with the game until the next thing comes out... But most MMOs want you to do every raid like 5 or 10 times to gear up for the next one and its just way too much work.

In most cases I would say the games are better experienced watching someone else do all the work for you."
"I mean... You're basically asking to only pay the sub for like one month out of the year. If you were willing to pay that sub x 12 for one month, then that might make sense, but there's a reason they want you to continue playing. 

You might even say they're banking on it lol."
"It's not purely monetary though. Half of the allure of MMOs is that you can be much stronger than other players and carve out a unique identity in the world. If everything were easy to get there would be no power dynamic and no balance to the in-game economy.

They generally reward high-level play and heavy organization; it's not easy to get a strong raiding team together, especially when one single player can ruin a boss fight.

I don't have time to play MMOs now but I don't think I would enjoy an MMO that required less of a time investment because of the above"
How about mmmmmmmmorpg?

"FFXIV's story is very very Final Fantasy. 

Not everyone is going to enjoy that, no matter how hard they try."
"I'm not saying you have to like it, but if you skip every single cutscene in a final fantasy game and then you write a review, I don't even know what to say to you."
"i remember someone reviewing warframe, a game you cant really start to have an opinion abot unless you played atleast over 50-100 hours because it snowballs into its own qualities, who never got past the first few level, saying stuff like ""all the weapons are boring, and the all the missions on the open world are way too hard""..

&#x200B;

someone checked his steam account and lo and behold he had 12 hours, and he only showed gameplay that would be equivalent to the first level... he got roasted for that"
"If I remember correctly, the IGN reviewer for Sekiro said the game is pretty easy comparably. While many other reviewers said it's very hard."
"It is, just a lot of souls fans are so used to rolling through attacks and playing defensively which is the opposite of what you want to do in sekiro."
"Just like the Spider-man PS4 reviewers who were trying to play it like the Arkham games or weren't using gadgets. Then docked the game a few points for 'bad combat'.

Makes me think what games I may have passed up due to an unmerited poor review by someone who didn't actually play it (or someone assigned the review who doesn't even like/play/understand the genre)."
"Spider-Man had really fun combat imo. My only problem was it was too short. They definitely could have made the story longer but the rest of the game was really good. 

I gave up on game reviews a long time ago though."
I'm starting to think about the IGN review for Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
7.8 too much water
"It's also hard to go into a game with a blank slate.  Like everyone was praising nier automata so I played it (very late) after playing dark souls 3 and devil may cry 5 so the game seemed very repetitive fast.  If I actually read reviews and went into it not expecting epic action but an amazing story I would have enjoyed it more.  

Or when i first played fallout 3 after oblivion and was bored quickly because i couldnt stealth like in oblivion. I've later played new Vegas with a different mindset and loved it."
"Sekiro is a game designed to appeal to dark souls fans but also to punish them for playing dark souls.  

Truly masterfully it is harder for the players who most crave difficulty."
"After playing it for three hours, it became very automatic and easy, aside from learning new enemies.

All they had to say was explaining that parry is the new roll, and it wasn't agonizingly frame perfect dark souls parry, it was the very generous roll window.

The few times timing is very important, there's a giant red kanji in your face followed by a white gleam for your ""push button now"" moment.

I'm pretty sure a lot of reviewers just dodged all game and never learned that isn't what sekiro is about."
Plus dodging backwards or to the sides gives you the shortest windows of invulnerability in the game. Forward dodge and jumping have more i-frames.
I agree with this opinion though. It is easy comparably.
imagine if they made the parry window as tight as it is in dark souls
The difference being if you fuck it you're going to absolutely eat shit in DS. The window is tight still but if you fail you just block and lose posture.
I mean tbf parrying is like the biggest most constant part of sekiro whereas in dark souls you can get by with just dodge hit 9 times out of 10.
"Or in the case of Dancer of the Bootylicious Valley, dodge, dodge, dodge, hit, run away"
"My opinion is that it is MUCH harder before it ""clicks"", and much easier AFTER it ""clicks"" compared to the same points in Bloodborne. I find Dark Souls a lot easier overall but I've also played that game for thousands of hours so hard to tell.

Bloodborne, before you ""get it"" you can still kinda brute force your way through things, but AFTER you ""get it"" there's still a lot of difficulty and limitations with stamina, knowing when to regain, etc.

Dark Souls, shields just kinda... make it a lot more accessible, and most of the ""click"" is just knowing parrying or how to safely pull enemies.

Sekiro, before you learn parrying, you're fucked. After you learn parrying, it's a matter of execution. There's no stamina bar, it's learning the rhythm of the enemy combos, sneaking in safe attacks to wittle down vitality, and knowing their unblockables."
"I don't disagree. The thing about DS and BB is that one mistake will means you will probably die, there's really no punishment for failure in Sekiro for a minor mistake. Plus vertical movement which we have never had."
"IGN is a real mixed bag because their review methodology boils down to throwing interns at the problem.  They have a lot of disposable reviewers they just chuck at games.  Some of them are clueless, some of them know their stuff."
"It’s probably the right way to do it, though. There’s probably like 10 new games a day on a slow day. There’s just way too much content for there to be a professional on staff person to cover everything. And they can’t miss anything because as much new stuff as there is there’s also someone that cares about all of it. Like they can’t just pick and choose because they’d be missing out on something 

It’s a competitive market. If you don’t have a video or a review on the latest game, someone else will, and eventually you’ll just get replaced."
"At least for IGN, I think it is the only solution.

IGN reviews everything.  Cheap manpower is the only way to do it."
"Until we create an AI that can do it for us, of course"
"To me the correct answer as a customer is to follow individual reviewers, and get to know their tastes and biases. With sites like IGN you often get the wrong person for the job. Still remember a site that put a guy who loathes platforms to review Tropical Freeze and it was nothing more than bashing the genre."
what about the dude who couldnt get out of the Cuphead tutorial.
"That used to be TotalBiscuit -- he was a YouTuber who would play, extensively, a variety of games, make a genuine and candid effort to be unbiased about games and to present them in context with their genres, and just generally do really in-depth reviews."
"Except TB insisted that his ""WTF is..."" series was not reviews. More akin to quick looks. He'd play a few hours of the game then show off the options menu and the core gameplay loop. Great for getting the ""feel"" of a game. Damn I miss him."
God help you if you didn't have a fully fleshed out options menu or rebindable keys! Which were definitely valid complaints.
Or FOV sliders!
"I never thought I'd get teary-eyed at a comment saying FOV sliders, wtf man"
I miss him like I miss rebindable keys on bad console ports.
I actually started tearing up a bit remembering his rants on FOV sliders and rebindable keys. Wtf is... Sadness and loss ):
There better be an FOV slider and proper audio-option in heaven or they're gonna get an earful.
"To be fair, games with rebindable keys can be literally unplayable for some people with disabilities and the like. Without a review like TB you wouldn't be able to know, as no longer other review will show the menu. Same for fov sliders. Some people get extremely nauseous from low fov again making the game unplayable."
Fuck I still miss this dude. His series was seriously one of the best...
"I mean, fine... But technically he *was* 'reviewing' the game, ironically in a manner that is more useful than pretty much any other review."
What happened to him?
"He passed away, unfortunately. It was a shock and a great loss to the community."
It wasn't really a shock...everyone knew it was coming.
"Not only did he die, but the /r/gaming logo being a british flag heart with a hat an the letters TB is in memory of him."
"F,    but unironically"
Uh...buddy....
"He died, actually."

"Rest well, TotalBiscuit.  You taught me the importance of having a good, detailed options menu."
I Miss biscuit. Was generally entertaining. Loved his street fighter commentary. He didn’t have a clue what was happening but hyped it up.
I think TotalBiscuit and Yogscast collabs alone got me into the let's play genre. Missing the giant...
"Even then, 20 hours isn't enough to finish some games. I just watched a video by a Youtuber who retracted their earlier opinion on Days Gone because apparently the last 10 hours were better than the first 25, as well as the game finally delivering on the horde clearing mechanic. 

The reviews are still out there, but they aren't syndicated anymore."
"Well, maybe I'm just less patient today, but I don't think ""it get's really good after 25 hours"" is a valid excuse. Games can and should be fun sooner than that. I'm okay with taking some time to establish everything, but 25 hours is too long.

Trim the fat. If there's not enough fun for 35 hours strip it down to 25."
"On a similar note, people have to stop trying to get people to like games by basically saying “just keep playing it gets good you’ll love it” till fucken Stockholm syndrome kicks in.  Like you shouldn’t have to play the whole game to know if you like it, you should know after the tutorial and the first level, maybe two if they are short levels."
"Same people with TV 

""Jusssst watch the first 4 seasons! It gets soooooo good after that!""

""How many episodes in a season ?"" 

""Uhhh.... like... 30. But they're only an hour each."""
"That's much more of an issue with games as a service though, that have a leveling/story phase, and endgame after that (where the ""real"" game begins).

Look at the glowing reviews Destiny 2 got when it came out, because 99% of the reviewers simply played the campaign and stopped after that.

Only the 1% reviewers that actually bothered to get into endgame found out how absolutely fucked it was, and gave the game absolutely terrible reviews (that it deserved at the time)."
Now d2 is in pretty good state
Yeah but I think 20 hours is enough time to decide whether it's worth a purchase.  Although that could depend on the game I guess.  If it's heavily story-driven and the ending is some worthless garbage then maybe completion is more of a factor.  But I think 20 hours is plenty of time for a person to have a say on the actual gameplay mechanics.
"My thoughts exactly.

For every ""the last 10 hours are AMAZING!""-Days Gone game, theres another ""the first 20 hours are AWFUL!""-Final Fantasy XIII.

At some point a reviewer needs to say ""the game has good parts, but getting to the good parts is not worth it""."
A lot of people will never play past that twenty hours.
"Yeah, no. That didn't happen.

I wrote for gaming websites twenty years ago. Went to E3 as press, all that good stuff.

I usually had six or eight games to review each week. I played hard and usually tried to make sure I saw different aspects of the game.

But I never had time to commit 20+ hours to anything.

I thought I would love being a game reviewer. But like any job, it became work."

"That reminds me of a review for one of the older PSP Monster Hunter games. The guy said something about being unable to get past the Kut-Ku and then trashed the game.

It ain't Monster Hunters fault you blow dicks at the game."
I quit on the level where you get to a hotel ran by a ghost or something. It was fun platformer with cute themes but I've got like 40 other games to play at the moment.
"Oh hey, I see you ayed FFXIII as well."
"The worst part about that game was how I hated every main character. You’d think with like 7 protagonists you’d find one you like, but they were all awful in different ways.

It’s bizarre that Snow, one the biggest scumbags and morons I’d ever seen, was one of the two primary protagonists. The game only got fun right at the very end for me, but I still regret playing it."
"I really wanted to like Sahz, but it's like 🙄 ok dude, we get it."
"To be fair, running around and shooting shit is most of borderlands."
"I relate to this comment so much, especially your last point. My first foray into gaming was my WoW seasoned friend(played since vanilla) introducing me to Cataclysm, the third expansion. I was constantly trying catching up to him and since he had already done pretty much every quest, he didn’t stop to read anything. It was my first mmorpg but we essentially played it like an mmo, and I didn’t experience any of the rpg. Now in later expansions that we play together, I’m still on a beeline to max level so we can get straight to the late-game action. I’ll be done with a quest before him and he’ll ask, “How did you finish reading the dialogue so fast?!” Simple, I didn’t. It’s not how I learned to play WoW, and trying to do it any other way feels like I’m wasting time."
"Exact same boat, I carried my friend through Earth nodes super fast and when we started a defense mission after 5 waves he tells me ""Oh man I can really feel the grind"". And then he never played afterwards, saying it was too grindy, without touching any other tileset, or any quests, or even any weapons beyond the MK-1 ones he chose from the tutorial."
"Ha! Five waves? If only he knew....

The game certainly doesnt do a good job of getting new players in right now. The weapons you get are really boring in every respect, and the early story isnt anywhere near as good as the newer stuff. Takes a certain kind of person to push through that stuff like we did"

Oh no... is... is that Billy?
"Yes, all of these are allegories for parenting."
Exactly how it went with my uncle and minecraft
"My Fiancee and I went on a minecraft date while LDR, that's pretty much how it went too."
Going on a date within a video game? That's quite an interesting idea. I'll have to try that one day...
"Before her laptop died me and the SO would spend most evenings playing Minecraft together while on the phone, we don't see each other very often and it made it easier to cope with being apart so long.

I'm trying to save up to buy her an xbox so we can play together again, it's really fun to have ""dates"" where we're chopping up zombies."
Me and my wife did that for a while. Now we live together and still do it in separate rooms on discord.
Yes I'll take a copy of this guys wife please
"Alrighty then.  With tax, that'll be three fifty."
Loch Ness monster pays his taxes I guess.
"""I thought I was getting a cool nerdy wife, but when she showed up at my door, I noticed she was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era! Wouldn't you know, it was that goddamn Loch Ness monster!"""
I also choose this guy's alive wife.
"Have done this with every partner I've ever had

Thought it was really common if you both liked games o.O"
"Well shit dude, this resonated with me. Me and my other half had to do long distance at the start and it's hard. Anything that makes it seem closer is awesome, how much have you saved so far? I'm keen to help."
Striking Vipers?
"It helps a lot! Somehow seeing their avatar in the game mentally feels like being with them, especially if you're voice chatting at the time. Definitely recommend for those in LDRs. Makes things a bit easier."
I moved 900 miles to be with my healer.
"It's great for first dates because there's a task you both have to accomplish to distract you from first-date-awkwardness and trying to force conversation.  It makes ""what to talk about"" very simple, the game going on in front of you, but the date is still valuable because it still shows you if you two connect or get along well."
Playing minecraft with my niece are some of my best memories with her. I miss when she wanted to hang out with me. She was the best kid.
You talk like she's dead now.
"If she doesn't play minecraft, what's the difference?"
"Not intended. She's just growing up and far away. She went to her prom a little bit ago. She's got tons of friends like she should, and living her best life. Her visits are precious to me, being so few and far apart. But she's got her own friends down here too, so I'm mostly chaperone/valet for her and her friends but it's still a blast."
I hope you tell her how much her and her visits mean to you.
"This is weird to read, because I'm the uncle in this scenario, and I did this with my niece when I found some diamonds in our mine."

"As DM, you should have fudged that and gave him the crit instead."
"No, you're supposed to have the party mourn his passing only to find his long-lost twin brother in a nearby cave."
"Holy shit, you beat me to my own words."
Would the brother then have to put on the robe and wizard hat?
"It’s an old meme, but it checks out."
"This is his twin brother Kimothy, but his friends call him.... Kiiiiiim?"
"He rolled in the open bruh, what can you do?"
Not do that
"DM has a right to adjust the rules within reason.  The critical strike on the wizard didn't have to kill him, could have KO'd him instead.

&#x200B;

I get it though, I've murdered whole parties of newbs as a DM by simply letting their stupid decisions play themselves out."
It did KO him. The wizard then proceeded to fail his death saves.
"Probably meant the DM could have made it non lethal and had them stable but unconscious. Maybe turn it into a kidnapping if you need further reasoning. They don't know the Kobolds stats. Make it apparently strong and fast or have an item to instantly teleport, literally anything, to make it so they player might still have a chance to be rescued or try to escape on their own later."
"It was a party failure, not a DM failure (except maybe rolling in the open). He failed a minimum of 3 saves. 3 rounds of combat where none of his fellow party members cast a heal or used a potion or attempted to stabilize.

It's very hard to outright die if your party cares about you, especially at low levels."
"Two saves, a natural one in 5th counts as two failures. Still the party is somewhat at fault."
I think there's a difference between a random ambush and the players being morons.
"*""But why would you charge them...?""*

""Whatever, just roll for it.""

""Tough luck..."""
"Forgive my ignorance, but what it rolling in the open?"
Not hiding the DM's dice rolls behinds a screen
"I very much disagree with you. Level 1 is the most dangerous level. The situation certainly sucks, but players need to accept that characters can die. It also sounds like while the crit downed the wizard there was more tomfoolery that ultimately signed their death certificate.

It is fine to play by the rules. It is fine for the DM to fudge the rolls here and there in secret for the story (how often and when is a complicated personal matter). But the DM decided they wanted to do open rolling and crit, they shouldn’t be expected to change the rules of the game because it might kill a player."
What's the point of rolling dice if the DM just decides something else happens if they don't like the result? What's the point of doing combat if the PCs have plot armor and there are no consequences?
"I remember I was playing some DnD alike and this guy who was playing with me had just rolled for loot on a some chest and got lucky enough to find an epic/legendary whatever flail weapon. No joke, they rolled for the weapon stats and that shit has indeed a fuckton of damage. We then continue.  GM tells us something like ""you hear a noise and are able to discern what looks like (insert medium difficulty monster here). What do you do?"" It's his turn, and he goes with ""FUCK YEA! I RUN AT HIM ROTATING MY EPIC FLAIL ABOVE MY HEAD WHILE SHOUTING INSULTS AT HIM! ONE HIT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO NUKE HIM!""
GM says: ""k, roll the dice""
Dude gets 1s in every single dice, an epic failure.
GM: ""...well you start dashing at him, shouting and taunting looking great. Mid run you trip on a rock, miss a swing and smash your head in with your the ball full of spikes of your awesome flail in an epic display of gore, arrogance and incompetence. A sight to behold, really. Monster sees that, start laughing at you, gets a morale boost of (rolls dice) and your party now needs to deal with the improved stats monster"".

We just didn't know how to react after that."

"My little brother is jaded to this day because of the controller tricks I used to pull.

My first prideful creation was a secret triple piston extender elevator that showed 0 redstone. (Wasn't very compact at ALL)
"I could never actually get that to work for some reason initially. It always used to confused the fuck outta me for whatever reason, but now I can build it multi-level."
"I remember when pistons first came out, I stayed up for hours making this cool automatic piston caterpillar moving thing, spent a while getting the timing done properly and making it work reliably, then I go on the forums and see someone made the same thing by just hooking it up to a 1tick redstone clock.

Serious question because I’ve been playing warframe on and off since PS4 launch and still don’t know what the hell i’m doing. Is that the preferred way to get good affinity? I have a ton of weapons and several prime frames now purely through trading now but my affinity level seems really low.
"Great way to level weapons and frames is Helene, Saturn, its a grineer defense that also drops orokin cells. Also this took me a while to figure out but you only get level exp the first time you get a weapon to 30, using a forma on it after and then getting it to 30 wont get you any level exp."
"Level as many weapons as possible, even if they suck. Increasing MR gives you more weapons, which means more affinity."

You got that right. Worst part is when your friend starts complaining about certain mechanics and talking shit about how certain parts of the game is dumb

  This. I tried getting my friends into XXX Babe Sex Wars and they hated it. At first I thought it was because I had a poor taste in game but now I know they just don't like puzzle games.
"That's a good point. Even though I know it's dumb and they're probably not looking down on me, sometimes I don't like learning a game in front of someone who's already great at it."
"> I always prefer being reckless, tanky/bruisery and fast-paced, while they prefer slower risk-management strategizing, optimizing and farming

One of my best friends and me are exactly like this dynamic

He loves to go in guns blazing, making as much noise as possible, as many explosions and bullet holes as possible, hates stealth levels with a fiery passion.

I love surgical strikes, being as quiet and unseen as possible, killing everything without ever being caught once (always sniper or rogue types), and stealth levels/games are my jam.

Borderlands 2 was a happy medium for us, as he got to do what he wanted playing Sal, and I got do what I wanted playing Zer0, and we could still play together without completely negating each others' playstyles."

"I mean the primary reason I do hate the vast majority of MMOs is typically because the content is heavily padded out and in many cases just not that interesting, i'd really rather just do a dungeon or a raid one time and move onto the next and then be finished with the game until the next thing comes out... But most MMOs want you to do every raid like 5 or 10 times to gear up for the next one and its just way too much work.

In most cases I would say the games are better experienced watching someone else do all the work for you."
"I mean... You're basically asking to only pay the sub for like one month out of the year. If you were willing to pay that sub x 12 for one month, then that might make sense, but there's a reason they want you to continue playing. 

You might even say they're banking on it lol."
"It's not purely monetary though. Half of the allure of MMOs is that you can be much stronger than other players and carve out a unique identity in the world. If everything were easy to get there would be no power dynamic and no balance to the in-game economy.

They generally reward high-level play and heavy organization; it's not easy to get a strong raiding team together, especially when one single player can ruin a boss fight.

I don't have time to play MMOs now but I don't think I would enjoy an MMO that required less of a time investment because of the above"

"I'm not saying you have to like it, but if you skip every single cutscene in a final fantasy game and then you write a review, I don't even know what to say to you."
"i remember someone reviewing warframe, a game you cant really start to have an opinion abot unless you played atleast over 50-100 hours because it snowballs into its own qualities, who never got past the first few level, saying stuff like ""all the weapons are boring, and the all the missions on the open world are way too hard""..

&#x200B;

someone checked his steam account and lo and behold he had 12 hours, and he only showed gameplay that would be equivalent to the first level... he got roasted for that"
"If I remember correctly, the IGN reviewer for Sekiro said the game is pretty easy comparably. While many other reviewers said it's very hard."
"It is, just a lot of souls fans are so used to rolling through attacks and playing defensively which is the opposite of what you want to do in sekiro."
"Just like the Spider-man PS4 reviewers who were trying to play it like the Arkham games or weren't using gadgets. Then docked the game a few points for 'bad combat'.

Makes me think what games I may have passed up due to an unmerited poor review by someone who didn't actually play it (or someone assigned the review who doesn't even like/play/understand the genre)."
"Spider-Man had really fun combat imo. My only problem was it was too short. They definitely could have made the story longer but the rest of the game was really good. 

I gave up on game reviews a long time ago though."
I'm starting to think about the IGN review for Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
7.8 too much water
"It's also hard to go into a game with a blank slate.  Like everyone was praising nier automata so I played it (very late) after playing dark souls 3 and devil may cry 5 so the game seemed very repetitive fast.  If I actually read reviews and went into it not expecting epic action but an amazing story I would have enjoyed it more.  

Or when i first played fallout 3 after oblivion and was bored quickly because i couldnt stealth like in oblivion. I've later played new Vegas with a different mindset and loved it."
"Sekiro is a game designed to appeal to dark souls fans but also to punish them for playing dark souls.  

Truly masterfully it is harder for the players who most crave difficulty."
"After playing it for three hours, it became very automatic and easy, aside from learning new enemies.

All they had to say was explaining that parry is the new roll, and it wasn't agonizingly frame perfect dark souls parry, it was the very generous roll window.

The few times timing is very important, there's a giant red kanji in your face followed by a white gleam for your ""push button now"" moment.

I'm pretty sure a lot of reviewers just dodged all game and never learned that isn't what sekiro is about."
Plus dodging backwards or to the sides gives you the shortest windows of invulnerability in the game. Forward dodge and jumping have more i-frames.
I agree with this opinion though. It is easy comparably.
imagine if they made the parry window as tight as it is in dark souls
The difference being if you fuck it you're going to absolutely eat shit in DS. The window is tight still but if you fail you just block and lose posture.
I mean tbf parrying is like the biggest most constant part of sekiro whereas in dark souls you can get by with just dodge hit 9 times out of 10.
"Or in the case of Dancer of the Bootylicious Valley, dodge, dodge, dodge, hit, run away"
"My opinion is that it is MUCH harder before it ""clicks"", and much easier AFTER it ""clicks"" compared to the same points in Bloodborne. I find Dark Souls a lot easier overall but I've also played that game for thousands of hours so hard to tell.

Bloodborne, before you ""get it"" you can still kinda brute force your way through things, but AFTER you ""get it"" there's still a lot of difficulty and limitations with stamina, knowing when to regain, etc.

Dark Souls, shields just kinda... make it a lot more accessible, and most of the ""click"" is just knowing parrying or how to safely pull enemies.

Sekiro, before you learn parrying, you're fucked. After you learn parrying, it's a matter of execution. There's no stamina bar, it's learning the rhythm of the enemy combos, sneaking in safe attacks to wittle down vitality, and knowing their unblockables."
"I don't disagree. The thing about DS and BB is that one mistake will means you will probably die, there's really no punishment for failure in Sekiro for a minor mistake. Plus vertical movement which we have never had."
"IGN is a real mixed bag because their review methodology boils down to throwing interns at the problem.  They have a lot of disposable reviewers they just chuck at games.  Some of them are clueless, some of them know their stuff."
"It’s probably the right way to do it, though. There’s probably like 10 new games a day on a slow day. There’s just way too much content for there to be a professional on staff person to cover everything. And they can’t miss anything because as much new stuff as there is there’s also someone that cares about all of it. Like they can’t just pick and choose because they’d be missing out on something 

It’s a competitive market. If you don’t have a video or a review on the latest game, someone else will, and eventually you’ll just get replaced."
"At least for IGN, I think it is the only solution.

IGN reviews everything.  Cheap manpower is the only way to do it."
"Until we create an AI that can do it for us, of course"
"To me the correct answer as a customer is to follow individual reviewers, and get to know their tastes and biases. With sites like IGN you often get the wrong person for the job. Still remember a site that put a guy who loathes platforms to review Tropical Freeze and it was nothing more than bashing the genre."
what about the dude who couldnt get out of the Cuphead tutorial.
"That used to be TotalBiscuit -- he was a YouTuber who would play, extensively, a variety of games, make a genuine and candid effort to be unbiased about games and to present them in context with their genres, and just generally do really in-depth reviews."
"Except TB insisted that his ""WTF is..."" series was not reviews. More akin to quick looks. He'd play a few hours of the game then show off the options menu and the core gameplay loop. Great for getting the ""feel"" of a game. Damn I miss him."
God help you if you didn't have a fully fleshed out options menu or rebindable keys! Which were definitely valid complaints.
Or FOV sliders!
"I never thought I'd get teary-eyed at a comment saying FOV sliders, wtf man"
I miss him like I miss rebindable keys on bad console ports.
I actually started tearing up a bit remembering his rants on FOV sliders and rebindable keys. Wtf is... Sadness and loss ):
There better be an FOV slider and proper audio-option in heaven or they're gonna get an earful.
"To be fair, games with rebindable keys can be literally unplayable for some people with disabilities and the like. Without a review like TB you wouldn't be able to know, as no longer other review will show the menu. Same for fov sliders. Some people get extremely nauseous from low fov again making the game unplayable."
Fuck I still miss this dude. His series was seriously one of the best...
"I mean, fine... But technically he *was* 'reviewing' the game, ironically in a manner that is more useful than pretty much any other review."
What happened to him?
"He passed away, unfortunately. It was a shock and a great loss to the community."
It wasn't really a shock...everyone knew it was coming.
"Not only did he die, but the /r/gaming logo being a british flag heart with a hat an the letters TB is in memory of him."
"F,    but unironically"
Uh...buddy....
"He died, actually."
We all miss him.
"Rest well, TotalBiscuit.  You taught me the importance of having a good, detailed options menu."
I Miss biscuit. Was generally entertaining. Loved his street fighter commentary. He didn’t have a clue what was happening but hyped it up.
I think TotalBiscuit and Yogscast collabs alone got me into the let's play genre. Missing the giant...
"Even then, 20 hours isn't enough to finish some games. I just watched a video by a Youtuber who retracted their earlier opinion on Days Gone because apparently the last 10 hours were better than the first 25, as well as the game finally delivering on the horde clearing mechanic. 

The reviews are still out there, but they aren't syndicated anymore."
"Well, maybe I'm just less patient today, but I don't think ""it get's really good after 25 hours"" is a valid excuse. Games can and should be fun sooner than that. I'm okay with taking some time to establish everything, but 25 hours is too long.

Trim the fat. If there's not enough fun for 35 hours strip it down to 25."
"On a similar note, people have to stop trying to get people to like games by basically saying “just keep playing it gets good you’ll love it” till fucken Stockholm syndrome kicks in.  Like you shouldn’t have to play the whole game to know if you like it, you should know after the tutorial and the first level, maybe two if they are short levels."
"Same people with TV 

""Jusssst watch the first 4 seasons! It gets soooooo good after that!""

""How many episodes in a season ?"" 

""Uhhh.... like... 30. But they're only an hour each."""
"That's much more of an issue with games as a service though, that have a leveling/story phase, and endgame after that (where the ""real"" game begins).

Look at the glowing reviews Destiny 2 got when it came out, because 99% of the reviewers simply played the campaign and stopped after that.

Only the 1% reviewers that actually bothered to get into endgame found out how absolutely fucked it was, and gave the game absolutely terrible reviews (that it deserved at the time)."
Now d2 is in pretty good state
Yeah but I think 20 hours is enough time to decide whether it's worth a purchase.  Although that could depend on the game I guess.  If it's heavily story-driven and the ending is some worthless garbage then maybe completion is more of a factor.  But I think 20 hours is plenty of time for a person to have a say on the actual gameplay mechanics.
"My thoughts exactly.

For every ""the last 10 hours are AMAZING!""-Days Gone game, theres another ""the first 20 hours are AWFUL!""-Final Fantasy XIII.

At some point a reviewer needs to say ""the game has good parts, but getting to the good parts is not worth it""."
A lot of people will never play past that twenty hours.
"Yeah, no. That didn't happen.

I wrote for gaming websites twenty years ago. Went to E3 as press, all that good stuff.

I usually had six or eight games to review each week. I played hard and usually tried to make sure I saw different aspects of the game.

But I never had time to commit 20+ hours to anything.

I thought I would love being a game reviewer. But like any job, it became work."

"The worst part about that game was how I hated every main character. You’d think with like 7 protagonists you’d find one you like, but they were all awful in different ways.

It’s bizarre that Snow, one the biggest scumbags and morons I’d ever seen, was one of the two primary protagonists. The game only got fun right at the very end for me, but I still regret playing it."
"I really wanted to like Sahz, but it's like 🙄 ok dude, we get it."
"Ha! Five waves? If only he knew....

The game certainly doesnt do a good job of getting new players in right now. The weapons you get are really boring in every respect, and the early story isnt anywhere near as good as the newer stuff. Takes a certain kind of person to push through that stuff like we did"

Going on a date within a video game? That's quite an interesting idea. I'll have to try that one day...
"Before her laptop died me and the SO would spend most evenings playing Minecraft together while on the phone, we don't see each other very often and it made it easier to cope with being apart so long.

I'm trying to save up to buy her an xbox so we can play together again, it's really fun to have ""dates"" where we're chopping up zombies."
Me and my wife did that for a while. Now we live together and still do it in separate rooms on discord.

"It's great for first dates because there's a task you both have to accomplish to distract you from first-date-awkwardness and trying to force conversation.  It makes ""what to talk about"" very simple, the game going on in front of you, but the date is still valuable because it still shows you if you two connect or get along well."
Playing minecraft with my niece are some of my best memories with her. I miss when she wanted to hang out with me. She was the best kid.

Her visits are precious to me, being so few and far apart. But she's got her own friends down here too, so I'm mostly chaperone/valet for her and her friends but it's still a blast."
I hope you tell her how much her and her visits mean to you.

"No, you're supposed to have the party mourn his passing only to find his long-lost twin brother in a nearby cave."
"Holy shit, you beat me to my own words."
Would the brother then have to put on the robe and wizard hat?
"It’s an old meme, but it checks out."
"This is his twin brother Kimothy, but his friends call him.... Kiiiiiim?"
"He rolled in the open bruh, what can you do?"
Not do that
"DM has a right to adjust the rules within reason.  The critical strike on the wizard didn't have to kill him, could have KO'd him instead.

&#x200B;

I get it though, I've murdered whole parties of newbs as a DM by simply letting their stupid decisions play themselves out."
It did KO him. The wizard then proceeded to fail his death saves.
"Probably meant the DM could have made it non lethal and had them stable but unconscious. Maybe turn it into a kidnapping if you need further reasoning. They don't know the Kobolds stats. Make it apparently strong and fast or have an item to instantly teleport, literally anything, to make it so they player might still have a chance to be rescued or try to escape on their own later."
"It was a party failure, not a DM failure (except maybe rolling in the open). He failed a minimum of 3 saves. 3 rounds of combat where none of his fellow party members cast a heal or used a potion or attempted to stabilize.

It's very hard to outright die if your party cares about you, especially at low levels."
"Two saves, a natural one in 5th counts as two failures. Still the party is somewhat at fault."
I think there's a difference between a random ambush and the players being morons.
"*""But why would you charge them...?""*

""Whatever, just roll for it.""

""Tough luck..."""
"Forgive my ignorance, but what it rolling in the open?"
Not hiding the DM's dice rolls behinds a screen
"I very much disagree with you. Level 1 is the most dangerous level. The situation certainly sucks, but players need to accept that characters can die. It also sounds like while the crit downed the wizard there was more tomfoolery that ultimately signed their death certificate.

It is fine to play by the rules. It is fine for the DM to fudge the rolls here and there in secret for the story (how often and when is a complicated personal matter). But the DM decided they wanted to do open rolling and crit, they shouldn’t be expected to change the rules of the game because it might kill a player."
What's the point of rolling dice if the DM just decides something else happens if they don't like the result? What's the point of doing combat if the PCs have plot armor and there are no consequences?
For a second I thought it was the back of a chair.

"I mean the primary reason I do hate the vast majority of MMOs is typically because the content is heavily padded out and in many cases just not that interesting, i'd really rather just do a dungeon or a raid one time and move onto the next and then be finished with the game until the next thing comes out... But most MMOs want you to do every raid like 5 or 10 times to gear up for the next one and its just way too much work.

In most cases I would say the games are better experienced watching someone else do all the work for you."
"I mean... You're basically asking to only pay the sub for like one month out of the year. If you were willing to pay that sub x 12 for one month, then that might make sense, but there's a reason they want you to continue playing. 

You might even say they're banking on it lol."
"It's not purely monetary though. Half of the allure of MMOs is that you can be much stronger than other players and carve out a unique identity in the world. If everything were easy to get there would be no power dynamic and no balance to the in-game economy.

They generally reward high-level play and heavy organization; it's not easy to get a strong raiding team together, especially when one single player can ruin a boss fight.

I don't have time to play MMOs now but I don't think I would enjoy an MMO that required less of a time investment because of the above"

"i remember someone reviewing warframe, a game you cant really start to have an opinion abot unless you played atleast over 50-100 hours because it snowballs into its own qualities, who never got past the first few level, saying stuff like ""all the weapons are boring, and the all the missions on the open world are way too hard""..

"If I remember correctly, the IGN reviewer for Sekiro said the game is pretty easy comparably. While many other reviewers said it's very hard."
"It is, just a lot of souls fans are so used to rolling through attacks and playing defensively which is the opposite of what you want to do in sekiro."
"Just like the Spider-man PS4 reviewers who were trying to play it like the Arkham games or weren't using gadgets. Then docked the game a few points for 'bad combat'.

Makes me think what games I may have passed up due to an unmerited poor review by someone who didn't actually play it (or someone assigned the review who doesn't even like/play/understand the genre)."
"Spider-Man had really fun combat imo. My only problem was it was too short. They definitely could have made the story longer but the rest of the game was really good. 

I gave up on game reviews a long time ago though."
I'm starting to think about the IGN review for Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.

"It's also hard to go into a game with a blank slate.  Like everyone was praising nier automata so I played it (very late) after playing dark souls 3 and devil may cry 5 so the game seemed very repetitive fast.  If I actually read reviews and went into it not expecting epic action but an amazing story I would have enjoyed it more.  

Or when i first played fallout 3 after oblivion and was bored quickly because i couldnt stealth like in oblivion. I've later played new Vegas with a different mindset and loved it."
"Sekiro is a game designed to appeal to dark souls fans but also to punish them for playing dark souls.  

Truly masterfully it is harder for the players who most crave difficulty."
"After playing it for three hours, it became very automatic and easy, aside from learning new enemies.

All they had to say was explaining that parry is the new roll, and it wasn't agonizingly frame perfect dark souls parry, it was the very generous roll window.

The few times timing is very important, there's a giant red kanji in your face followed by a white gleam for your ""push button now"" moment.

I'm pretty sure a lot of reviewers just dodged all game and never learned that isn't what sekiro is about."
Plus dodging backwards or to the sides gives you the shortest windows of invulnerability in the game. Forward dodge and jumping have more i-frames.
I agree with this opinion though. It is easy comparably.
imagine if they made the parry window as tight as it is in dark souls
The difference being if you fuck it you're going to absolutely eat shit in DS. The window is tight still but if you fail you just block and lose posture.
I mean tbf parrying is like the biggest most constant part of sekiro whereas in dark souls you can get by with just dodge hit 9 times out of 10.
"Or in the case of Dancer of the Bootylicious Valley, dodge, dodge, dodge, hit, run away"
"My opinion is that it is MUCH harder before it ""clicks"", and much easier AFTER it ""clicks"" compared to the same points in Bloodborne. I find Dark Souls a lot easier overall but I've also played that game for thousands of hours so hard to tell.

Bloodborne, before you ""get it"" you can still kinda brute force your way through things, but AFTER you ""get it"" there's still a lot of difficulty and limitations with stamina, knowing when to regain, etc.

Dark Souls, shields just kinda... make it a lot more accessible, and most of the ""click"" is just knowing parrying or how to safely pull enemies.

Sekiro, before you learn parrying, you're fucked. After you learn parrying, it's a matter of execution. There's no stamina bar, it's learning the rhythm of the enemy combos, sneaking in safe attacks to wittle down vitality, and knowing their unblockables."
"I don't disagree. The thing about DS and BB is that one mistake will means you will probably die, there's really no punishment for failure in Sekiro for a minor mistake. Plus vertical movement which we have never had."

what about the dude who couldnt get out of the Cuphead tutorial.
"Except TB insisted that his ""WTF is..."" series was not reviews. More akin to quick looks. He'd play a few hours of the game then show off the options menu and the core gameplay loop. Great for getting the ""feel"" of a game. Damn I miss him."

Now d2 is in pretty good state
Yeah but I think 20 hours is enough time to decide whether it's worth a purchase.  Although that could depend on the game I guess.  If it's heavily story-driven and the ending is some worthless garbage then maybe completion is more of a factor.  But I think 20 hours is plenty of time for a person to have a say on the actual gameplay mechanics.
"My thoughts exactly.

For every ""the last 10 hours are AMAZING!""-Days Gone game, theres another ""the first 20 hours are AWFUL!""-Final Fantasy XIII.

You should give it another go. Celeste has a very robust assist mode that allows you to customize the difficulty in a lot of ways. If you test it out even the worst players and those with motor disabilities can both enjoy and beat the game.
"You can bypass Dark Souls games' difficulty with grinding levels/gear/skills to the point that you can easily handle ""hard"" encounters.  

Sekiro and Celeste require you to execute a series of button presses accurately.  Grinding doesn't help you.  The only way to beat them is to improve the way you play the game.  These kinds of games aren't for everyone."

Wonder how long it'll be before they change that. Cos its OP as frick. Get your trades in quick boys!
We can just use a version before they patch it! Good thing Minecraft lets you do that
Even minecraft has a fucking meta now. I'm getting old.
How do you ‘make them zombies’? Do you just wait for them to get killed by a regular zombie?
"I have a system. Get a zombie that can pick up items (they don’t de spawn when they hold something) put them in a glass tube (have dealings when working with zombies, helmets only last certain times) with flowing water so they are stuck in a corner. Have the corner block be removed (still stuck in but so a minecart can pick them up through the wall. Drop a villager in and wait for it to get turned. Have the minecart track that leaves from that corner and  have a fork in the track so you can send the zombie back into the tube and the other way sends them to the trading hall. From there cure them and place down a lectern (if you want enchants). Note sometimes a glitch hapenes where the librarian decides to untrade themselfs so ALWAYS have the stuff to buy the books (couple of emeralds and books) because once you buy from them they are locked but before you make that first trade, if you back out to go grab your stuff to trade they might lose that trade you wanted

If you guys want a vid I can make one since this is my own design based on things I’ve seen different people do. I have not seen one do it this way, the closest I’ve seen is Ph1lza does this but doesn’t realize zombie villagers that you make do the same thing.

I’ll probably make the vid tomorrow or the next day once I finish it myself because my old world deleted itself so I had to start over

Edit: forgot to mention that villagers only take on trades during certain times of the day

Edit 2: should also give advice on getting emeralds. With this technique not many emeralds and needed so the farmer isn’t needed. This is mainly because the librarian sells 3 bookcases for 1 emerald after you cure them. 1 emerald buys you 9 books than sell those books back to the same villager for 1 emerald for 1 book or something close. AKA FREE STOINKS

Going on a date within a video game? That's quite an interesting idea. I'll have to try that one day...
"Before her laptop died me and the SO would spend most evenings playing Minecraft together while on the phone, we don't see each other very often and it made it easier to cope with being apart so long.

I'm trying to save up to buy her an xbox so we can play together again, it's really fun to have ""dates"" where we're chopping up zombies."
Me and my wife did that for a while. Now we live together and still do it in separate rooms on discord.

"It's great for first dates because there's a task you both have to accomplish to distract you from first-date-awkwardness and trying to force conversation.  It makes ""what to talk about"" very simple, the game going on in front of you, but the date is still valuable because it still shows you if you two connect or get along well."
You talk like she's dead now.
"If she doesn't play minecraft, what's the difference?"
"Not intended. She's just growing up and far away. She went to her prom a little bit ago. She's got tons of friends like she should, and living her best life. Her visits are precious to me, being so few and far apart. But she's got her own friends down here too, so I'm mostly chaperone/valet for her and her friends but it's still a blast."
I hope you tell her how much her and her visits mean to you.

It did KO him. The wizard then proceeded to fail his death saves.
"Probably meant the DM could have made it non lethal and had them stable but unconscious. Maybe turn it into a kidnapping if you need further reasoning. They don't know the Kobolds stats. Make it apparently strong and fast or have an item to instantly teleport, literally anything, to make it so they player might still have a chance to be rescued or try to escape on their own later."
"It was a party failure, not a DM failure (except maybe rolling in the open). He failed a minimum of 3 saves. 3 rounds of combat where none of his fellow party members cast a heal or used a potion or attempted to stabilize.

It's very hard to outright die if your party cares about you, especially at low levels."

But most MMOs want you to do every raid like 5 or 10 times to gear up for the next one and its just way too much work.

In most cases I would say the games are better experienced watching someone else do all the work for you."
"I mean... You're basically asking to only pay the sub for like one month out of the year. If you were willing to pay that sub x 12 for one month, then that might make sense, but there's a reason they want you to continue playing. 

You might even say they're banking on it lol."
"It's not purely monetary though. Half of the allure of MMOs is that you can be much stronger than other players and carve out a unique identity in the world. If everything were easy to get there would be no power dynamic and no balance to the in-game economy.

They generally reward high-level play and heavy organization; it's not easy to get a strong raiding team together, especially when one single player can ruin a boss fight.

"It's also hard to go into a game with a blank slate.

If I actually read reviews and went into it not expecting epic action but an amazing story I would have enjoyed it more.  

Or when i first played fallout 3 after oblivion and was bored quickly because i couldnt stealth like in oblivion. I've later played new Vegas with a different mindset and loved it."
"Sekiro is a game designed to appeal to dark souls fans but also to punish them for playing dark souls.  

Truly masterfully it is harder for the players who most crave difficulty."
"After playing it for three hours, it became very automatic and easy, aside from learning new enemies.

All they had to say was explaining that parry is the new roll, and it wasn't agonizingly frame perfect dark souls parry, it was the very generous roll window.

The few times timing is very important, there's a giant red kanji in your face followed by a white gleam for your ""push button now"" moment.

I'm pretty sure a lot of reviewers just dodged all game and never learned that isn't what sekiro is about."
Plus dodging backwards or to the sides gives you the shortest windows of invulnerability in the game. Forward dodge and jumping have more i-frames.
I agree with this opinion though. It is easy comparably.
imagine if they made the parry window as tight as it is in dark souls
The difference being if you fuck it you're going to absolutely eat shit in DS. The window is tight still but if you fail you just block and lose posture.

If you guys want a vid I can make one since this is my own design based on things I’ve seen different people do. I have not seen one do it this way, the closest I’ve seen is Ph1lza does this but doesn’t realize zombie villagers that you make do the same thing.

I’ll probably make the vid tomorrow or the next day once I finish it myself because my old world deleted itself so I had to start over

Edit: forgot to mention that villagers only take on trades during certain times of the day

Edit 2: should also give advice on getting emeralds. With this technique not many emeralds and needed so the farmer isn’t needed. This is mainly because the librarian sells 3 bookcases for 1 emerald after you cure them. 1 emerald buys you 9 books than sell those books back to the same villager for 1 emerald for 1 book or something close. AKA FREE STOINKS

Edit 3: [Here is the vid i made](https://youtu.be/tOwGF_Lfe4I) (sorry for length and bad audio)"
"I haven't played since I couldn't get afk fish to work on android, wonder if that's fixed yet?"
"IT WAS SAID THAT YOU WOULD FINISH THE BRIDGE, NOT LEAVE IT IN DARKNESS

"Before her laptop died me and the SO would spend most evenings playing Minecraft together while on the phone, we don't see each other very often and it made it easier to cope with being apart so long.

I'm trying to save up to buy her an xbox so we can play together again, it's really fun to have ""dates"" where we're chopping up zombies."
Me and my wife did that for a while. Now we live together and still do it in separate rooms on discord.
Yes I'll take a copy of this guys wife please
"Alrighty then.  With tax, that'll be three fifty."
Loch Ness monster pays his taxes I guess.
"""I thought I was getting a cool nerdy wife, but when she showed up at my door, I noticed she was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era! Wouldn't you know, it was that goddamn Loch Ness monster!"""
I also choose this guy's alive wife.
"Have done this with every partner I've ever had

Thought it was really common if you both liked games o.O"
"Well shit dude, this resonated with me. Me and my other half had to do long distance at the start and it's hard. Anything that makes it seem closer is awesome, how much have you saved so far? I'm keen to help."
Striking Vipers?
"It helps a lot! Somehow seeing their avatar in the game mentally feels like being with them, especially if you're voice chatting at the time. Definitely recommend for those in LDRs. Makes things a bit easier."
I moved 900 miles to be with my healer.
"It's great for first dates because there's a task you both have to accomplish to distract you from first-date-awkwardness and trying to force conversation.  It makes ""what to talk about"" very simple, the game going on in front of you, but the date is still valuable because it still shows you if you two connect or get along well."
"If she doesn't play minecraft, what's the difference?"
"Not intended. She's just growing up and far away. She went to her prom a little bit ago. She's got tons of friends like she should, and living her best life. Her visits are precious to me, being so few and far apart. But she's got her own friends down here too, so I'm mostly chaperone/valet for her and her friends but it's still a blast."
I hope you tell her how much her and her visits mean to you.
Did I miss it?
"No friend, you are right on time."
Everyone is here :')
Don't mind me. Just a stowaway on the history boat...

"It’s an old meme, but it checks out."
"DM has a right to adjust the rules within reason.  The critical strike on the wizard didn't have to kill him, could have KO'd him instead.

&#x200B;

I get it though, I've murdered whole parties of newbs as a DM by simply letting their stupid decisions play themselves out."
It did KO him. The wizard then proceeded to fail his death saves.
"Probably meant the DM could have made it non lethal and had them stable but unconscious. Maybe turn it into a kidnapping if you need further reasoning. They don't know the Kobolds stats. Make it apparently strong and fast or have an item to instantly teleport, literally anything, to make it so they player might still have a chance to be rescued or try to escape on their own later."
"It was a party failure, not a DM failure (except maybe rolling in the open). He failed a minimum of 3 saves. 3 rounds of combat where none of his fellow party members cast a heal or used a potion or attempted to stabilize.

It's very hard to outright die if your party cares about you, especially at low levels."
"Two saves, a natural one in 5th counts as two failures. Still the party is somewhat at fault."
I think there's a difference between a random ambush and the players being morons.

"Somewhat similar, I loved Mortal Kombat on the NES, it was so easy the game played itself! Never could cross the first level though..."
"I remember when I was a kid, my older brother used to play Time Crisis on PS1 all the time. What he and my parents did was that they'd flip over this tiny chair for me to act like a bunker, and gave me one of those gun controllers while my brother played on a regular controller. Kid me had a blast aiming the Guncon and seeing the enemies get shot down, thinking that I was the one who did it."
My younger brother used to curb stomp pubbies online in halo at around that age.
You'd be surprised how quickly young children learn.
Do you know what that monstrosity  was supposed to do? Open a door with a button?
"Apparently, it’s a calculator: capable of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing."
"See, simple"
"it is actually very simple. its just a LOT of very simple parts. kindve like a colouring-in book but it's for the entire sistine chapel rather than just one page. anyone can do it, it just takes a long time"
One guy coded the entire (IIRC) “pokemon gold and silver” game in Minecraft using command blocks and redstone. It looked like that but even more insane.
I'd say the harder part is usually making it compact and/or fast
"Making a small alu in minecraft is pretty easy, making the rest of the CPU is a bit technical, and then making the memory and the display is tedious. By small alu I mean simple, the most simple alu implements and, or, not, and xor, you could replace the xor with addition. And from there you need to implement some registers, and the CPU architecture, like can you do math on a memory address or do you need to load and store to do math on a memory address, from this point you need to design your pipeline, and then you need to implement the following operations: compare, and, or, not, xor, add, subtract, load, store and jump/goto/branch, and a conditional jump/goto/branch. And then you will have a turning complete CPU, just hook up some memory and a way to read the outputs and, you would have a programmable computer in minecraft, and if you exclude the add and subtract operations of the CPU it would theoretically be one of the more simple cups you could make, you could go super risc and have only a not and an and operation along with the non alu operations for the simplest computer in minecraft."

"Whoever made the PKMN Red and Blue did freaking great, the FireRed while also being badass was a bit laggy"

"""I was gonna simulate the universe, but it was a little too laggy when running OBS."""
"Last week i built a on/off lights switch for my room and only cried three times, so proud."
My first redstone invention was a little contraption on top of my house that replaced a wooden block in the middle of my roof with a lit redstone lamp when night fell. I've made larger things since but I still hold pride from that moment for whatever reason.
My first prideful creation was a secret triple piston extender elevator that showed 0 redstone. (Wasn't very compact at ALL)
"I could never actually get that to work for some reason initially. It always used to confused the fuck outta me for whatever reason, but now I can build it multi-level."
"I remember when pistons first came out, I stayed up for hours making this cool automatic piston caterpillar moving thing, spent a while getting the timing done properly and making it work reliably, then I go on the forums and see someone made the same thing by just hooking it up to a 1tick redstone clock. Feels bad."
You mean to tell me you didn't immediately start trying to build death traps the second you found out what Redstone was?
It's too bulky really - if you want to go in proper on the logic and automation nonsense you need mods that add redstone wires and logic gates
It already does? Fourth column in the table

"I mean the primary reason I do hate the vast majority of MMOs is typically because the content is heavily padded out and in many cases just not that interesting, i'd really rather just do a dungeon or a raid one time and move onto the next and then be finished with the game until the next thing comes out... But most MMOs want you to do every raid like 5 or 10 times to gear up for the next one and its just way too much work.

In most cases I would say the games are better experienced watching someone else do all the work for you."
"I mean... You're basically asking to only pay the sub for like one month out of the year. If you were willing to pay that sub x 12 for one month, then that might make sense, but there's a reason they want you to continue playing. 

You might even say they're banking on it lol."
"It's not purely monetary though. Half of the allure of MMOs is that you can be much stronger than other players and carve out a unique identity in the world. If everything were easy to get there would be no power dynamic and no balance to the in-game economy.

They generally reward high-level play and heavy organization; it's not easy to get a strong raiding team together, especially when one single player can ruin a boss fight.

I don't have time to play MMOs now but I don't think I would enjoy an MMO that required less of a time investment because of the above"
How about mmmmmmmmorpg?

"I'm not saying you have to like it, but if you skip every single cutscene in a final fantasy game and then you write a review, I don't even know what to say to you."
"Just like the Spider-man PS4 reviewers who were trying to play it like the Arkham games or weren't using gadgets. Then docked the game a few points for 'bad combat'.

Makes me think what games I may have passed up due to an unmerited poor review by someone who didn't actually play it (or someone assigned the review who doesn't even like/play/understand the genre)."
"Spider-Man had really fun combat imo. My only problem was it was too short. They definitely could have made the story longer but the rest of the game was really good. 

I gave up on game reviews a long time ago though."
I'm starting to think about the IGN review for Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
7.8 too much water
"It's also hard to go into a game with a blank slate.  Like everyone was praising nier automata so I played it (very late) after playing dark souls 3 and devil may cry 5 so the game seemed very repetitive fast.  If I actually read reviews and went into it not expecting epic action but an amazing story I would have enjoyed it more.  

Or when i first played fallout 3 after oblivion and was bored quickly because i couldnt stealth like in oblivion. I've later played new Vegas with a different mindset and loved it."
"Sekiro is a game designed to appeal to dark souls fans but also to punish them for playing dark souls.  

Truly masterfully it is harder for the players who most crave difficulty."
"After playing it for three hours, it became very automatic and easy, aside from learning new enemies.

All they had to say was explaining that parry is the new roll, and it wasn't agonizingly frame perfect dark souls parry, it was the very generous roll window.

The few times timing is very important, there's a giant red kanji in your face followed by a white gleam for your ""push button now"" moment.

I'm pretty sure a lot of reviewers just dodged all game and never learned that isn't what sekiro is about."
Plus dodging backwards or to the sides gives you the shortest windows of invulnerability in the game. Forward dodge and jumping have more i-frames.
imagine if they made the parry window as tight as it is in dark souls
The difference being if you fuck it you're going to absolutely eat shit in DS. The window is tight still but if you fail you just block and lose posture.
I mean tbf parrying is like the biggest most constant part of sekiro whereas in dark souls you can get by with just dodge hit 9 times out of 10.
"Or in the case of Dancer of the Bootylicious Valley, dodge, dodge, dodge, hit, run away"
"My opinion is that it is MUCH harder before it ""clicks"", and much easier AFTER it ""clicks"" compared to the same points in Bloodborne. I find Dark Souls a lot easier overall but I've also played that game for thousands of hours so hard to tell.

Bloodborne, before you ""get it"" you can still kinda brute force your way through things, but AFTER you ""get it"" there's still a lot of difficulty and limitations with stamina, knowing when to regain, etc.

Dark Souls, shields just kinda... make it a lot more accessible, and most of the ""click"" is just knowing parrying or how to safely pull enemies.

Sekiro, before you learn parrying, you're fucked. After you learn parrying, it's a matter of execution. There's no stamina bar, it's learning the rhythm of the enemy combos, sneaking in safe attacks to wittle down vitality, and knowing their unblockables."
"I don't disagree. The thing about DS and BB is that one mistake will means you will probably die, there's really no punishment for failure in Sekiro for a minor mistake. Plus vertical movement which we have never had."
"At least for IGN, I think it is the only solution.

IGN reviews everything.  Cheap manpower is the only way to do it."
"Until we create an AI that can do it for us, of course"
"To me the correct answer as a customer is to follow individual reviewers, and get to know their tastes and biases. With sites like IGN you often get the wrong person for the job. Still remember a site that put a guy who loathes platforms to review Tropical Freeze and it was nothing more than bashing the genre."
Or FOV sliders!
"I never thought I'd get teary-eyed at a comment saying FOV sliders, wtf man"
I miss him like I miss rebindable keys on bad console ports.
I actually started tearing up a bit remembering his rants on FOV sliders and rebindable keys. Wtf is... Sadness and loss ):
There better be an FOV slider and proper audio-option in heaven or they're gonna get an earful.
"To be fair, games with rebindable keys can be literally unplayable for some people with disabilities and the like. Without a review like TB you wouldn't be able to know, as no longer other review will show the menu. Same for fov sliders. Some people get extremely nauseous from low fov again making the game unplayable."
What happened to him?
"He passed away, unfortunately. It was a shock and a great loss to the community."
It wasn't really a shock...everyone knew it was coming.
"Not only did he die, but the /r/gaming logo being a british flag heart with a hat an the letters TB is in memory of him."
"F,    but unironically"
Uh...buddy....
"He died, actually."
Now d2 is in pretty good state
Wonder how long it'll be before they change that. Cos its OP as frick. Get your trades in quick boys!
We can just use a version before they patch it! Good thing Minecraft lets you do that
Even minecraft has a fucking meta now. I'm getting old.
How do you ‘make them zombies’? Do you just wait for them to get killed by a regular zombie?
"I have a system. Get a zombie that can pick up items (they don’t de spawn when they hold something) put them in a glass tube (have dealings when working with zombies, helmets only last certain times) with flowing water so they are stuck in a corner. Have the corner block be removed (still stuck in but so a minecart can pick them up through the wall. Drop a villager in and wait for it to get turned. Have the minecart track that leaves from that corner and  have a fork in the track so you can send the zombie back into the tube and the other way sends them to the trading hall. From there cure them and place down a lectern (if you want enchants). Note sometimes a glitch hapenes where the librarian decides to untrade themselfs so ALWAYS have the stuff to buy the books (couple of emeralds and books) because once you buy from them they are locked but before you make that first trade, if you back out to go grab your stuff to trade they might lose that trade you wanted

This makes MMO's hard to get into for people who don't already have a group of friends playing or who aren't getting in at the start of an expansion... but it also makes the games hard to review because you spend a week on a game that then might be a completely different experience once you get to max level..."
"It's not purely monetary though. Half of the allure of MMOs is that you can be much stronger than other players and carve out a unique identity in the world. If everything were easy to get there would be no power dynamic and no balance to the in-game economy.

They generally reward high-level play and heavy organization; it's not easy to get a strong raiding team together, especially when one single player can ruin a boss fight.

I don't have time to play MMOs now but I don't think I would enjoy an MMO that required less of a time investment because of the above"

I miss him like I miss rebindable keys on bad console ports.
I actually started tearing up a bit remembering his rants on FOV sliders and rebindable keys. Wtf is... Sadness and loss ):
There better be an FOV slider and proper audio-option in heaven or they're gonna get an earful.
It wasn't really a shock...everyone knew it was coming.
