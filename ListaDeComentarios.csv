Confirming a helicopter crash."
"I can’t believe it. This fucking sucks. His poor wife and daughters..

Edit: I just found out his daughter Gianna was onboard. My heart breaks for everyone involved. It puts life into perspective, showcasing how chaotic it truly is."
let's hope his daughters weren't on board
"Apparently they weren’t thank goodness

EDIT: WOJ confirmed that his 13 year old daughter Gianna was on the helicopter with him. Absolutely terrible."
"Absolutely. Not that the other four on board makes this any less tragic, of course (and just as much sympathy goes out to them as well). But if it was him and his kids... my God. That'd be absolutely horrible.

Edit: It appears reports are now confirming one of his daughters was on board. Adrian Wojnarowski is also saying that another parent and daughter were accompanying them on their way to a practice. :("
"Many families losing a piece is somehow easier to accept than an entire family checking out at once, or both parents..."
Hence Saving Private Ryan.
Oh yeah. Forgot that was basically the incident
"I'm reading that his daughters were on board. I hope this report is false.

EDIT: Confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was on board as well. None of his other kids were."
"https://twitter.com/LASDHQ/status/1221514409056432128

The LA County Sheriff's department is confirming there was a helicopter crash in Calabasas and that 5 people have died but no names have been released yet so this is sounding very real.

Edit: There are people saying that his daughters were with him and there are people also saying that Rick Fox was with him so there is a lot of misinformation being spreaded now. As of now, the only person we absolutely know was on the ~~plane~~ Helicopter was Kobe so it's better to wait for some confirmation on the other people on the plane.

Edit #2:  12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.

Edit #3: Multiple sources are saying that Rick Fox is safe and well the information spread about him being in the helicopter is not true.

Edit #4: There were 9 people on the plane including Kobe and his daughter Gianna. Three of them have been identified as Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife and his daughter"
"Such a terrifying way to go, too.  Shit."
Absolutely awful seeing as he's been on countless helicopter rides. One of my worst fears is to be on a plane and it just suddenly malfunctions and crashes.
"If it’s worth anything to you, with a large plane, as most of us go on, it’s one of the safest things you could use for transportation. These helicopters and small planes are definitely the highest possibility for aviation crashes though."
"The human brain is weird man. People feel safe and in control in a car on the ground but it’s statistically far far more dangerous than flying, which people are afraid of

edit: alright I fuckin get it, planes have a high fatality rate when they malfunction mid-flight. 50 people already replied it thanks"
"It probably has to do with us thinking because we have control, we'll be fine."
"Also probably because it’s scarier to be 30,000 feet in the air and fall to your death than to get into a car accident"
There was just an accident next to my house. Driver was texting and hit a family. I'd much rather be in a plane where the pilot is highly trained and has to undergo rigorous testing. The only thing keeping you safe when you drive is a yellow line painted on the ground
I think the biggest concern with people is that a fender bender is a bit of whiplash and an insurance call. A plane crash is almost certain death.
"Nah, the data isn't simply comparing being more likely to get in an accident, its literally comparing chance of dying, which is much much higher in cars."
This is one of the reasons that I will never fly in a small plane/helicopter. Something like 95% of all aircraft crashes are these small private craft.
"Small planes are pretty safe - even if the engine dies, they have the highest glide ratios of any aircraft, and can almost always get to somewhere safe to land. When helicopters fail it's a hope and a prayer, despite pilots being trained to autorotate down.

It's why I have zero desire to get into helicopters."
"As a heli pilot myself who has trained to do auto rotations and have been with pilots who can do it with their eyes closed, I can tell you that the pilot that flew for someone of Kobe's stature was probably an elite pilot. Someone who could do autos in their sleep and controlled the helicopter like a puppet. Even so, when shit goes wrong on a heli, even the best of the best can't do much once you start to fking spin and lose all control. It's fucked up."
What are some of the possible situations that can happen that lead to spinning out of control?  Is something like that occurring more likely to be due to weather conditions or a mechanical failure?
"Highest probable causal factors considering the low vis/fog in the area (in order of likelihood):

1. Vertigo (pilot's perception of up/down/left/right didn't match reality)
2. Obstacles (tower, power line, or rising mountain terrain obscured by low visibility)
3. CFIT (Controlled flight into terrain, aka pilot doesn't notice constant steady rate descent or rising terrain)
4. Loss of Tail Rotor Drive

Likely you have a little of column 1 and column 2 which led to column 3"
helicoptering to me never seems in control. you're fighting constant changing variables. Fuck that.
LSU's OC daughter in law died in a small plane crash too.
"A plane can and will glide for awhile, a plane *wants* to fly.  A helicopter...does not."
A helicopter can autorotate and land safely with no power
Life is so weird.
"“12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13.
We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks."
It has to be... god damn
Ny post verified Kobe was on board as well.
"I can’t believe it, the guy has flown in helicopters for years to travel around for games and now, right after the birth of his last daughter in the prime of his lifetime, it fails him :(. 

Terrible news"
was Kobe the pilot of the helicopter?
"~~He was a certified pilot in case of emergency, but I highly doubt he was the usual pilot.~~ Everything I've seen says there was an onboard fire and, depending on where it was, there is fuck all you can do about that.

Edit: I've been corrected about him being a pilot."
wonder how the fire started
"He is not a certified pilot.

https://amsrvs.registry.faa.gov/airmeninquiry/Main.aspx"
"No he hired a personal pilot. 

The helicopter he usually flew on was a Robinson R44 I think which are popular for training but unique from other Helis due to using a flat 4 piston engine instead of a turbine. They’re also know for having many deadly crashes from defective rotor blades and weak fuel tank design like passengers could survive the impact but fuel tank breaks engulfing the survives in flames"
If it's known for the failures why are they still made?
It was actually a Sikorsky S-76B confirmed by the heli-association. Reason for crash is unknown
"Don’t think so, it caught fire and that’s how it crashed"
"Fuuuck... That would be scary, RIP Kobe."
"It’s not really appropriate but I always wonder how people react in those last minutes.

Do they freak out like most of us? Are they as cool under pressure as they are when they’re down by 2 with 0:04 remaining. I know we’ll never know but I always like to pretend in moments like that, they are the exact same as we remember them."
"I can't stop thinking about the same thing. I've buried far too many friends in the last 3 years, and for some reason there last thoughts/words are always what I think about most.

I honestly feel like it shakes me up even more thinking Kobe was just stone faced and calm throughout all this. The man was a human, which was/is easy to forget when you've looked up to him as something bigger than life for over a decade. I can't handle/process the idea of Mamba Kobe going down at the moment.

As terrible as it is that him and his daughter passed, I hope that they were at least able to comfort each other in there final moments. It's all we can really hope for right now."
"I often spend more time wondering about things like that. Did they have time to comfort each other? Or was it a very sudden—things were fine, then they weren’t, and it’s over type—situation?

I know we will most likely never know. I had family on the Air France 447 flight that went down in between Brazil and France. The pilot’s instruments froze and he pulled up, taking the plane into a very slow, apparently almost unnoticeable stall. Over the years I have spoken with many flight engineers who said my sister would probably have had no idea what was happening and didn’t feel anything when she went. I always pray that was true."
"Your sister was on Air France 447? Damn, that is rough. For what it is worth from a complete stranger on the interwebs, I can tell you that those flight engineers you spoke to are 110% correct with what they told you. None of the passengers knew anything was about to happen because the plane was in a stall, not a dive, and it was instantaneous. 

Now, Kobe’s crash, holy shit, it seems that he may have had quite a bit of time before his death, 10 seconds at least, up to a minute if the chopper was at a higher altitude. Brutal man, absolutely brutal."
"What wrenches my heart is what went through his mind knowing his daughter was going to die. I'm not saying I'd be cool and collected facing my own death, but as a father, just thinking of my daughter also dying is horrific. This is what's eating me up right now."
Yeah man. I have a two year old daughter and another kid on the way. I immediately went and gave my wife and little one the biggest hug possible. Shit really is different when you have kids.
"Losing a game won't end your life, they freak out like all of us and panic too."
Many people are calm before death
"Yeah I can see him being calm before death but the fact that his daughter was on it, he was definitely freaking out."
"Yeah, I can't imagine what he was feeling, knowing his daughter was going to die beside him. So incredibly sad."
Probly just held his daughter
What else could you do. Death is inevitable. At least they had each other in the end.
"I dunno, I was in a car that rolled down a hill and once we started flipping over I pretty much just accepted whatever was going to happen. Your body doesn’t bother panicking when you know there’s nothing you can do."
"It’s not inappropriate, death conjures weird feelings and makes us think deeply about things like this.. wanting know how someone reacts in they’re last moments may come off as *insensitive to those more closely attached to the situation but it’s perfectly naturally to be having those thoughts.. I’m sure the Mamba’s up there helping god improve his baseline post fade."
"Thanks. That means a lot, Internet friend."
"Literally was having this discussion when that plane in Iran went down. Horrifying way to go, imagine those last few seconds of your life, literally out of your control & nothing you can do. I pray to never experience this.


RIP"
His 13 year old daughter died with him too. Life sucks
Holy shit. This can’t be true
I just can't imagine Kobe not being around. This is one of the biggest moments in sports history outside of the game
"I barely know an NBA without Kobe, I figured he’d be one of those elder statesmen being courtside and around the game for decades to come"
He would’ve and should’ve been... fuck man
His poor family
It breaks for my heart for his kids. Just had one in June. Unbelievable. I can't believe this what the actual fuck.
"Yeah i was just thinking about his daughters. He was always so involved with them, he always talked about them like they were his world. God, even just saying ""was"" feels wrong"
He absolutely would have been. He loved the game like no one else.
Like we just saw him congratulate Lebron. I thought I would see Kobe around basketball for most of my life but he's suddenly just gone.
I'm in full blown denial.
"I barely know an NBA without Kobe, I figured he’d be one of those elder statesmen being courtside and around the game for decades to come"
"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas

looks like there was a crash reported earlier today with no names holy fuck"
this will be the sports equivalent of Princess Diana’s death.
"This is absolutely crazy, it's fucking surreal"
It cant be real
"Unfortunately, reports look like it's real. Holy smokes."
That's a spot on analogy. Fucking crazy news.
I’ll probably never forget this moment the rest of my life. Was about to jack off and checked reddit real quick and damn
I think the sports equivalent of that would be like kobe dying during his prime or something. This is still terrible but a little different
"Nah, especially since we saw a glimpse of Kobe’s post playing career, there is no doubt he is was going to remain well in the public eye with all
His off court work"
"I dunno about that - Diana's death had a lot of outside context where the paparazzi that hounded her was largely responsible.

This is a terrible, unexpected tragedy and I don't mean to lessen or undermine your grief, I just want to mention there was more to Diana's death.

**EDIT:** To be a little more constructive, I would liken this more to Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens' plane going down."
I’m shook.
More than shook. What the fuck
I'm so fucking shaken right now
"https://twitter.com/abc7curt/status/1221517701987721216

abc confirmed it.  fucking devastated

edit: daughter gianna on board helicopter. R.I.P to a legend.

"Not often that you have to open breaking news with ""not a joke""."
Sad truth about the bullshit social media times we live in...this is fucking crazy
"That's true but this is also one of those stories that is SO out there and unexpected, it's 100% natural to doubt it at first regardless of the source.   Fucking crazy man, this is some Steve Prefontaine shit."
I’m numb. What do you do? Kobe was such an influence and icon to so many fans let alone the players. I think the NBA needs to take a couple days to let the league come to grips and deal with this loss. Fuck man
TMZ are known to be reliable when it comes to celebrity stuff so I'm prepared for the worst.
No one would risk their reputation reporting this kind of news if it weren't true. I can't believe it too but I'm genuinely aching man.
"My fondest memory playing youth basketball was getting to play one on one with Kobe when he visited the Army post I lived on in Korea as a kid. He was such a big part of my love for basketball growing up, this shit hits hard even though I didn’t know him."
"Despite the shallow gossip stuff they usually cover, TMZ is surprisingly reliable with reporting, mainly because they know celebrities would sue the hell out of them for libel if they misreported something. Sadly, I think this is true."
"Fuck, this hits hard. One of my childhood idols. Can't believe this"
"Already up on their IG. TMZ does not fail in stuff like this and I'm just too realist to harbour hopes they have been hacked or something.

I'm speechless. Best I can say is condolences to the family. If today I'm an NBA fan is due to guys like him when I was growing up. Never rooted for the Lakers or him (but he was a joy to watch play, specially when he was in that zone), but nobody can deny he's one defining piece in NBA history. and his presence will be missed.

Rest in peace legend and champ."
"Just confirmed by ABC7 in LA. He's gone. RIP Mamba

Edit: just confirmed by TMZ that his daughter GiGi was also on board. Awful"
[Woj confirmed](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)
"I think it's thanks to Chappelle but I used to yell ""Kobe"" when jacking 3's in pickup lol. Damn"
"Man, I'd yell Kobe when doing anything even remotely close to shooting a basket. Still going to."
"Trash can basketball REQUIRES yelling ""KOBE"" when tossing a paper towel away. It's the law"
I can't believe it dude. Kobe Bryant is dead. Fuck man. This is awful news.
I can't even believe it. This doesn't even feel possible. What the fuck.
Yeah my brain does not compute. Like everything points to it being a real story but I literally can't believe it.
"I’m devastated, man. Just devastated."
"I wasn't even a Lakers fan but this is just so so so so depressing. He's done so much for basketball. I feel so bad for his daughter and family in general, he was such a great dad :(

Edit: Tmz just confirmed his daughter was on the helicopter as well. Fuck :("
"Man, he was always supposed to be one of my enemies as a Celtics fan but i could never bring myself to disliking him. What the fuck. This is so fucking upsetting"
This is hard to accept for real
2020 is off to an incredibly insane start and January isn’t even over yet.
"I feel you. I’m heartbroken. Not a Kobe fan, not a Lakers fan. Doesn’t matter. Wife and 4 daughters, was only 41...it’s just devastating. Feel like I need to go call my mom."
"I’m in Sydney, it’s 6:45am my brother ran into my room telling me. I just don’t know. I flew all the way to Cleveland to watch him vs Bron..."
Kobe felt untouchable
"It feels like a fucking shitty generated story from a game or something.

WHAT THE FUCK? NO! We were supposed to have 50 years of his old man banter with Lebron! 

Fucking WHAT???"
"I’m completely shook right now.

Grew up watching him."
It's so out of the fucking blue. Truly shocking and terribly sad.
"at the gas pump and the woman next to me is ~~balling~~ bawling. 

This is awful.

Edit: fixed it ya jerks lol. Fuck though."
It's what Kobe would want
"Lol fuck you for making me laugh right now.

Seriously though, thanks for this."
 #mambamentality
Fuck you for making me laugh at that.
You have to laugh at death
wtf man.  This is crazy.  That is so sad.
What the fuck man this has to be fake
Vanessa went private on Instagram so I think it may be true unfortunately
i’m literally in shock
Twitter turned off trending
"Twitter’s broken, searching up “Kobe” won’t load anything"
I think Twitter broke.
His article on wikipedia has crashed to because all of the traffic.
"As someone who avoids twitter, can someone please explain why they’d do this?"
"I don't think they turned it off, it just broke due to high traffic."
I can’t believe this
He seemed like one of those guys that would just be around forever
"NBA greats tend to stay forever. We still have Bill Russell, for Christ's sake."
I know black doesn’t crack but he just always looked so young to me. Like he’d be around spreading his nba wisdom until the heat death of the universe
It's not like he was 60. He just retired a few years ago.
"I kind of never considered the possibility that Kobe was a mortal who *could* even die. He was like the timeless, ubiquitous embodiment of basketball. Fuck."
Yeah it sounds made up. Completely out of the blue.
"Please tell me that's fake.

Edit: R.I.P"
"Its probably true. La times article about a crash in calabasas posted 30 min before Tmz https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas

edit: It's been confirmed by multiple sources now. Woj confirmed it as well. https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?s=19"
Jesus Christ I feel like I’m about to throw up
"This will be the biggest ""celebrity death"" for me, it's fucking crazy"
It’s just so out of the  blue. If he was getting really old then you kinda have the time to mentally prepare yourself but a sudden crash at 41 years old? Fuck man
"Bruh what really gets me is that before the game last night, me and my friends were discussing if LeBron was gonna take his foot off the pedal against the Sixers so that he could pass Kobe in scroing vs the Clippers in LA in front of a ""home"" crowd.

Now imagine if that had been the case"
"Like, if this happened when he was 70... It would be ""easier"". But just four years ago he was dropping 60 points. Fuck me.

RIP Mamba. One of the very best."
I've been a Kobe hater basically my whole life and I feel the same way. Can't even imagine what a gut punch this news must be for Lakers fans.
This is a gut punch for anyone that's a basketball fan. This is so fucking awful.
I am fucking destroyed right now.
"https://twitter.com/latimes/status/1221517388056629248

They're working on confirming who was in the crash.

Edit: Police has confirmed to variety https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/kobe-bryant-dead-helicopter-crash-lakers-1203480844/

Also Local ABC, ESPN... fuck man"
At this point he would have spoken up had he not been in the crash
It's surreal it's something that I just don't want to believe.  This is the first celebrity death that hits so close to home.
Holy fucking shit. I hate that I want this to be fake but TMZ is never wrong about celebrity deaths...
Tmz is a reliable source. This is fucking insane.
I wish it was any other outlet. TMZ more reliable than Reuters about this kind of thing. I’m in shock.
"This fucking sucks.

Edit: There should be a second black bar on jerseys for the remainder of the season. He meant so much to the game and the modern NBA. Again, this fucking sucks."
I don’t even think I have feelings yet. Total shock. Seems fake but I know it’s not.
Same. I can't even think right now
"This doesn’t feel real. Like I know it is, but it doesn’t feel real."
"It feels like a stupid ass rumor that will get disproven... it’s stunning. But I know TMZ doesn’t fuck around with this shit

If it’s really true, RIP Kobe."
"They broke the news about Paul Walker as well, right? Man I hope this is not true.."
They broke news about Juices death too. He’s gone.... RIP to a goat
And MJ way back
Michael Jackson
"Yeah, TMZ is probably the most legit source in the world when it comes to celebrities of different kinds, they wouldnt put something like this out there if it wasnt 100% true.

fuuuuuuuck man, this cant be happening, this is the biggest celebrity to die since Michael Jackson, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This was so out of the blue, what the fuck..."
I swear I legitimately feel sick. Celebrity deaths don’t usually even affect me that much. Jesus Christ.
"Still feel like this is fake, but it's TMZ...man this is so fucked up..."
"> Celebrity deaths don’t usually even affect me that much.

Most celebrities aren't watched for 2-3 hours 82-100 times per year for 20 years. For many, Kobe was as central a piece of their living room as their sofa."
TMZ is reliable af for celebrity death news
Yes. I still remember the day they were the first announcing Michael Jacksons death.
"Yep and everybody was waiting for a “more reliable” source. 

TMZ is on top of its celebrity passing game."
"And this is something you don’t want to be wrong on, because if they were to be wrong, that’s a death knell"
TMZ usually gets it right on celebrity deaths.
"Yeah. And this is the kind of thing where if they got it wrong, their erroneously reporting it will be a *huge* deal and a massive black eye for them.

Really hope they got it wrong, though."
"There's no way they would run this if they weren't almost 100% sure. 

They're wrong a lot but usually about menial shit like when GSP retired from MMA and they speculated it was because he had a baby with his secret girlfriend"
This is a punch to the gut. Sudden deaths are the worst.
He was such a young person still as well. The thought of a guy like him dying in the near future never even felt like a real possibility.
i remember they broke michael jackson's death first. they're pretty reliable unfortunately
Jesus he just had another kid.
Fuck. His poor family. This is awful.
"Fuck, heartbreaking"
This is the worst I’ve ever felt about an athlete’s death. Fuck man
"This is the first athlete’s death that I watched as a kid, my heart feels empty right now."
Wtf.....
I just got on break at work and I’m fucking shook
This is the first celebrity death that hit me hard. My grandmother passed away this morning as well... it's been the worst fucking day
Damn man I hope you'll be okay.
I'm sorry for your loss
"I literally just re-watched his final 2016 game last night, and his final speech really resonated with me. He talked about how 20 years went by so fast, how his wife held the family down while he spent countless hours in the gym and he even cracked a joke about how his whole career people told him to pass, but tonight everyone said “Don’t pass it!” As he broke 60 points in his last game. Just made me think about how sometimes we put athletes in this realm in our heads of them not being real people, but they got just as much going on in their personal lives as we do. Rip"
"> his final 2016 game

Man, that wasn't even that long ago. Dude was still in the early years of his retirement with so much ahead of him."
Right? I remember that night so vividly. I remember Kanye posting his ticket and saying he couldn’t wait to see mamba’s last game. Time flies time flies
"I was flicking back and forth between the Warriors 73rd win and Kobe’s last game. Ultimately, couldn’t miss that 4th quarter Kobe"
Dude my sister called me about this. I can’t find any other reports. Please be a mistake. Anyone know if he was at the 76ers game last night?
he congratulated lebron and said he wanted to be there when he passed him just like jordan was for him. fuck man
What the fuckkkkk
This is one of the most surreal deaths of a famous person. I’m still in shock. This just doesn’t make sense holy shit
"Aside from the grief of his family, I can’t imagine how Lebron might feel about this. Kobe was supporting him all the way. From one legend to another. This fucking sucks. Thoughts out to his family."
Don't think so
I don't think he was and you can't really fly a helicopter cross country? It says it happened in Calabasas which well north of Newport Beach where he lives? Could be just visiting friends up there or something
I was just watching Kobe highlights last night. I don’t want to believe this.
"One of the greatest athletes our species has ever produced. 


He was just incredibly... special."
"I legitimately never really could comprehend why people would cry and get emotionally torn up when a celebrity/musician/athlete/an icon in their life passed away. Someone they never met.

For the past 30 years I’ve always been a Kobe Stan. All my basketball gear, workout clothes, jerseys, all Kobe. Went to his last game live and saw him score 60 with my saved up money. Always defended Kobe in any debate. As lame as it may sound, even in my darkest times in life I was able to pull through and be hopeful because I knew Kobe wouldn’t be down on himself in a time like this. Kobe was legitimately my idol. 

I understand now. This one really hurts."
"Man same. Started playing ball because Kobe was out there tearing it up every night, and I watched in awe when he dropped those 60 on his last game, inspired the new generation and was shaping up to become a legend off the court as well... I’m in tears rn"
"Keep carrying on Mamba's legacy, man."
"I'm shook and I wasn't even a Laker fan. Loved his killer instinct and work ethic. A brilliant mind too. I was looking forward to his basketball commentary for DECADES to come! So awful, I feel sick."
When you see the registration number on the aircraft that crashed it matches the reg number on the helicopter that Kobe frequently traveled in. So so so sad.
"What was the registration? N76EX? I'm buddies with the Chief pilot of that company and he's not answering his phone. I'm praying he wasn't the one flying.

Edit: it was him"
"Hope everything turns out ok with your friend. 

https://twitter.com/bdp473/status/1221502829245763584?s=21"
I've flown 72EX (not with Kobe in it). Hope it wasn't my guy. Great pilot thousands of house. You hate to see it man
"Apparently there was an onboard fire before they crashed. Even with thousands of verified flight hours, there are some unforeseen circumstances that will kill you, no matter how experienced you are."
That makes more sense than what I initially thought was an engine failure. The Sikorsky has two engines so unless both failed simultaneously they wouldn't have slammed into the ground.
"This doesn't feel real.

Kobe is invincible."
"Kobe’s camp would’ve already come out to deny this report.

This is awful."
Watching Vanessa accept Kobe’s HoF induction is going to be heartbreaking
"Oh god, I don’t think I’m gonna be able to watch that. I’ll end up as a wreck trying to watch that"
"He deserved to make a HOF speech, he deserved to be announced as part of the next top 50 NBA players, he deserved to see the Lakers win another ring later in his life, and present the trophy to them. He deserved to see grandchildren, the futures of all his girls, and live a great life, even for what he had already achieved. Rest in peace, Kobe."
"Another reminder that rich or poor, powerful or powerless us humans or life for that matter is a blink away from being gone from this world.
So sad."
"Damn man if it’s true its fucking crazy sad. His last tweet was him congratulating Lebron James. 
https://twitter.com/kobebryant/status/1221276426164269056?s=21"
"No fucking way its true, the day after he passes the torch to Bron as #3? You couldnt write that shit"
Real life kinda sucks :/
"Reality is stranger than fiction sometimes man, not even 24 hours after he gives his blessing to Bron and Bron hyping him up for 4 mins after the game"
This shit is crazy. I honestly cant believe it.
Theres just something so poetic about that being the last thing he ever said to the public
He is only 41 years old wtf man
No one would even want to write that shit.
I don't want to be reading this shit. Fuck me man. I barely know an NBA without him around.
[Kobe's last tweet ever](https://twitter.com/kobebryant/status/1221276426164269056)
I really hope it’s the last one and nobody takes over. It’s surreal that was his last tweet
"Man fuck...he was just congratulating Lebron last night. The guy is my idol, and this is soul crushing. I feel so bad for his family"
[Woj Confirmed. Kobe's gone. RIP](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?s=19)
The darkest day in basketball history
"This is the absolute lowest I've ever felt as an NBA fan.  

As much as I hated him torching my team, I grew into an adult watching him play.

It's like having your heart ripped out, man."
I just feel a mixture of emptiness and confusion. My mind can't even process the fact that this is all happening. It doesn't feel real.
I just assumed he'd be with us and active in the sport decades into the future like a Bill Russell type of figure.  This is just so depressing.
This and Len Bias are terrible tragedies. My heart goes out to his family and his four daughters. Literal just had another daughter too. So tragic.
"> This and Len Bias are terrible tragedies.

Drazen Petrovic as well."
TMZ doesn't fuck up when it comes to these kinds of stories... what a terrible horrible surprise this is.
Unfortunately TMZ is super reliable on this stuff...damnnnnn!!!!!
"what the fuck...

edit: is this a fake report or something?

edit 2: TMZ is usually legit, but this is just...what the fuck.

edit 3: jesus fuck looks like it's real. Sorry to the Bryant family, and just what the hell. RIP Kobe"
"It's gotta be real. Here's a tweet with Kobe and his helicopter - an S76  [https://twitter.com/sikorsky/status/720670572477358081?lang=en](https://twitter.com/sikorsky/status/720670572477358081?lang=en)

and this article posted an hour earlier mentions that the helicopter that crashed was an s76. Then TMZ I guess was able to confirm that Kobe was inside.

[https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/01/26/aircraft-reported-down-in-calabasas-no-word-on-injuries-or-deaths/](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/01/26/aircraft-reported-down-in-calabasas-no-word-on-injuries-or-deaths/)

Edit: Woj confirms it  [https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?s=19](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?s=19)"
Fuck
Wtf could’ve happened to the helicopter for it to crash? this is crazy
"Being reported as ""foggy conditions"". We could speculate until we're blue in the face at this point, but the reports of both ""foggy conditions"" and ""crashing into hillside"" seem to line up to they ran into the side of a hill/mountain because the pilot(s) had really low visibility causing a low amount of time to react."
"Helicopters, like most aircraft, are very reliable and safe compared to automobiles. But when they do go down the chances of surviving a crash are slim to none."
I thought I always heard helicopters were really dangerous and it doesn't take a lot to make them crash.
TMZ is usually pretty accurate with celebrities deaths sadly
"It’s kinda crazy how good TMZ is at reporting about important things. They have a lot of good exclusives, sadly in this case"
It’s cause they pay the most for the story
"tmz surprisingly aren’t typically wrong about stuff like this. what the fuck

edit: https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas

looks like a second source..."
Can’t posting this kind of news without confirmation. It would ruin tmz
TMZ is usually pretty legit about this kind of stuff. Jesus Christ.
Holy shit guys??? Kobe RIP. Legitimately a legend. Wow I'm still shocked
bro what the fuck
Fuck 2020
Wait what the fuck
This shit better not be true
Sadly it looks like it
This is awful. His poor kids.
"Dang I’ve never been shaken by a celebrity death before, but this is something else. RIP Kobe, you’ll be missed."
WTF
"Wow, this gives a pit stomach feeling."
"At least he was comfortable with death 


https://www.theringer.com/2016/11/11/16087158/kobe-bryant-lakers-interview-retirement-shoes-death-36f099f28196"
"> What’s your relationship with death?

>A comfortable one.

>Yeah?

>It’s a comfortable one. It’s an understanding. You can’t have life without death. Can’t have light without the dark. So it’s an acceptance of that. When it came time to decide whether or not I should retire, [it was] really an acceptance of that mortality that all athletes face. And if you combat it, you’ll always have that inner struggle within yourself. … So … I’m comfortable with it.

Wow..."
"He lived a full life. Honestly the saddest part of all of this is his daughter was there with him. I can’t imagine how he felt when that heli was going down... probably just wished it was only him and not her. 

I really hope there’s something after death and that they’re together right now."
Fuck....just....damn
"Actually crying while reading this, thank you for the link."
"The NBA should cancel one game for every team so everyone only plays 81 games. RIP, Mamba"
No way this is real. I refuse to believe it is. After Lebron passes him for third all time? This is so heartbreaking to the sports world. My heart literally dropped at reading this headline.
"This is horrible news to hear 

Rip to one of the goats"
"Who else grew up shouting KOBE whenever throwing anything ;( 

RIP"
"Gone before he even got indicted into the HOF. Just an all around tragedy for everyone involved and their families. Life is precious, hug your loved ones."
"> indicted into the HOF

Um, wrong word choice there."
"https://twitter.com/LASDHQ/status/1221514409056432128?s=19

La County Sherrifs confirm 5 dead at a helicopter crash."
I know no one is gonna read this but this hurts more than any other former player death would. Kobe is the reason I started watching basketball. I remember being a little kid watching the playoffs with my dad and thinking Kobe was the coolest guy in the world. I’m gonna miss him so much
NO IT CANT BE TRUE
RIP
Who tf buys the “yas queen” and “made me smile” awards for this. Go to hell.
I don’t think I’ll ever be able to comprehend this headline
I'm shaking what the fuck
This is one of the most devastating sports deaths of our lifetime.  Truly unbelievable.
"I can’t think of anybody recently who has died, while they were young, who was honestly in the mention of greatest scorer ever.

This is gonna be THE most devastating sports death in the last 30 years."
"This like, doesn’t feel real? Wtf I hope it’s fake but it’s being reported more and more. Fuck I’m speechless. I’ve never been shocked more by news"
Every now and then I'll sort by top all-time and still can't believe what's at the top.
This is just horrid. Never got to give his HOF speech. An all time legend. Induct him immediately NBA. Retire 8 and 24. RIP to possibly the best ever.
"I’m going to choose to believe that after getting passed by LeBron, Kobe has decided to fake his death and use anti-aging technology to come back to the league. This can’t be real."
"thank you for the humor, i needed that ❤️"
"wow

this is surreal............like one of those i'll remember where i was moments 

helicopters are death traps .........

RIP 

feel awful for his daughters, especially the one who'll never get to know him"
LA TIMES reported a helicopter crash 1 hour ago. That much is legit. The helicopter is also the same as Kobe’s.
To everyone who's wondering how to deal with this news: Realize life has an end and it may come anytime. Stop postponing things and live each day to the fullest.
"""Five people confirmed deceased, no survivors in #Calabasas helicopter crash. #LASD #Malibu deputies remain with #LA County Fire personnel. Investigation ongoing. ""

Avoid the area until further notice.

Tmz doesnt report fake deaths. God damn RIP
He was just tweeting yesterday :(((
He was already trending on twitter prior to this. I can't believe the timing with LeBron passing him just yesterday. RIP Kobe!
"That was what I thought, saw RIP Kobe trending and my immediate thought was it was just people memeing about LeBron passing him on the scoring list. Jesus Christ."
"That was what I thought too -- someone texted me ""Kobe may have just died"" and it seemed like a joke about him being mad at LeBron. The first stories that pop up on Google are still about the scoring list."
I will never process this
No way.  What the fuck?
"TMZ crashed their site and it says ""Technical Difficulties""

Please be fake..."
"Hard to comprehend. He shaped basketball for my generation. He was fun to root for, and often even more fun to root against. The outpouring of love that is about to descend on his legacy is going to be remembered for a long, long time."
"Kobe was supposed to be the Bill Russell grandfather figure of the NBA in 30 years. Mentoring young players, showing up to Finals games and Allstar games getting a ton of applause, handing out awards. Completely at peace having accomplished everything he set out to do in life. That’s just how it was supposed to be, period. There’s no way he is supposed to be gone like this. This is the absolute saddest moment in the history of the NBA. I’ll never forget the headline of this thread and how utterly alien it looked as I read it over and over."
"The last 24 hours I haven't stopped thinking about the loss of Kobe, and how I could be this emotional for losing someone I've never met. I've wondered if I'm being selfish for feeling pain when I know it can't compare to what the other families are experiencing right now. I've come to the conclusion that I'm not crazy and this isn't selfish. 


A generation grew up knowing who Kobe was — the near perfect combination of extreme talent mixed with unwavering determination. Whether you're an NBA fan and saw him on the TV in your living room every week for nearly two decades or only heard about him winning his numerous titles casually, I think we all knew of his trademark Mamba Mentality. He preached about the importance of practice, setting aside the necessary time to perfect one's craft, and bettering yourself every day in order to achieve your goals. 


Our generation is now attempting to achieve those goals. We got our university degrees and certifications, we've landed our first or second career job, and many of us are trying or beginning to start a family of our own. Somehow it feels like a distant uncle, someone we idolized from afar, someone who told us to believe in ourselves throughout our childhood, was taken from this earth without notice. It's a sad day. 


Hopefully what I've written down can help you understand the sadness you may feel too. I know it's helped me."
"When I was 8 years old I got my first basketball video game (NBA Inside Drive 2004). The only player I knew at the time was Shaq, so my first few games were played as the Lakers.

After playing I got to know the names of the other players, and I found out there was a “Bryant” on the team. I didn’t know this was *the* Kobe Bryant, but I liked the name Bryant so I usually passed him the ball cause Shaq was terrible when shooting and dribbling.

As I played more games I got to be really good with Bryant, and soon I figured that you could edit the stats of the players. So I turned Kobe’s up to 99 for everything and went to town on the other teams. 

Kobe scored over 450 points in one game. I’d steal the ball, go outside the 3 point line, shoot a fade-away and then steal the ball on the inbounds pass. Rinse and repeat.

That process happened so quickly, the announcer wouldn’t even have time to finish saying “Kobeeeeeee Bryyyyaaaant!” Because by the time he got to the “Bryyyy” part I’d have already made another 3. 

Time went on and I eventually learned that the Bryant I was playing as was *the* Kobe Bryant. I was kind of a dumb 8 year old.

It makes me sad that the first NBA player I really liked is gone."
Who the fuck gave the yas queen award? Fuckin muppet
I don't care if someone hits a game 7 finals buzzer beater game winner. This post should stay top post of all time forever. Such a tragedy we should remember forever
"The people that gave this post a ""Yaas Queen"" and ""Made me Smile"" awards are pieces of shit, and whenever they die the whole world will smile."
Raptors first possession they let they shot clock expire to honour #24. Then the Spurs did it.
Still can't believe you're gone :'(
"https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?s=20

Woj just dropped the news and confirmed it. So very tragic"
This is absolutely crazy
"I’m trying to process why Kobe’s death is earth shattering. 

It has something to do with the fact that he’s the first NBA superstar to die. Before Jordan. Before Kareem. Hell, before Magic and Larry! 

Damn. What do GOAT discussions look like when the person is dead?! 

Condolences to the Bryant Family."
This is going to be the darkest week in NBA history
What kind of fucked up timeline are we living in where Kobe fucking Bryant dies dude wtf man fuck this
"Not the black mamba man, dude has enjoying his life after retiring so sad."
"RIP, loved to hate him in the 2000s, but he was certainly a legend."
"Wow, this might be the first time in my young life that a celebrity death has gotten to me. I legit loved watching him for years as a kid until adulthood. This hits right in the feels."
And this after Leicester City FC lost their owner in a helicopter crash last year. The worst method of transportation.
"Confirmed by Kobe's family. 
https://twitter.com/marclamonthill/status/1221520549706444801

R.I.P."
Let’s hope the ABC reporter confused “survived by his 4 daughter”
Yelling “Kobe” after shooting a basketball shot is going to hit a little different now
"One of my students who lives in LA said that a mother and daughter who went to his (the student’s) school also died in the crash. She played basketball with Kobe’s daughter. Then I’d imagine the 5th was the pilot. 

So it seems it would be Kobe, GiGi, Unnamed Mother and daughter, and the pilot"
The terror of realizing moments before crashing that you and your daughter are going to die..condolences to his fam.
"Kobe was above the NBA, and even basketball. He was an ambassador for sports across the entire globe. He was a pillar of an entire culture that bled into music, arts, black identity, American identity, and beyond.

Honestly one of the most shocking deaths in a long time."
"I can’t sleep. My heart aches knowing that Gianna couldn’t live her life, and that her father couldn’t enjoy his retirement and accomplish all the thing he wanted after basketball. Fuck man. I hate this."
"If true this is gonna take me months or even years to process, doesn't seem real at all. Dude was only 41. This is about to be the biggest thread in /r/nba history"
"TMZ also reporting :

**Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13.**

**We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.**

Kobe Bryant died in a helicoper crash in Calabasas Sunday morning ... TMZ Sports has confirmed.

Kobe was traveling with at least 3 other people in his private helicopter when it went down. A fire broke out. Emergency personnel responded, but nobody on board survived. 5 people are confirmed dead. We're told Vanessa Bryant was not among those on board."
"I first saw this on a restaurant sign as I was driving back into town. They always have lame jokes on the sign and I spent a few minutes wondering how '8   24   RIP Kobe' was supposed to be funny

RIP everyone lost today"
"I just realized we won't be able to hear his Hall of Fame speech or see him unveil his Lakers statue outside Staples Center. I can't fucking take this, man. 💔"
The sheriff just announced that there were 9 people killed on board.
"Just saw an ABC news report that the weather was so poor for flying this am, no LAPD helicopter was cleared to fly 

It seems so senseless that kobe's pilot would take off in those conditions 

Similar thing happened with JFK jr's plane crash - bad weather"
"As nutty as r/NBA can get, I think we can all agree that this is a got damn shame."
Gonna get buried under the thousands of comments but love is really the most important thing there is. We are never truly in control so lets appreciate every moment we have here and try to be as loving as possible to everyone.
This cannot be real 😭😭
This can’t be real.
"This will go down as the most popular and the most tragic post in r/nba history.

I thought all the ""RIP Kobe"" posts were referring to his place on the all-time scoring ladder. Fucking nuts."
"Wtf people like him can’t just go and die at 41. And in a helicopter crash of all!? After everything his done, all the work he put in, just to have it ripped away at 41. He should’ve been waddling into a game at 90 years old and a kid should’ve been asking his grandfather who that Bryant guy was that the camera kept panning over to. Just what the fuck man."
Man I miss you.
Please please please dont be true
No no no nooo
Yo fuck helicopters...
"Jay William's on espn talking about kobe. ""Just tell the loved ones you have, you love them. No matter what problems you have big or small. You just gotta let that shit go."" He apologized and the anchors on ESPN just told him dude you are fine l. Its okay."
I genuinely cannot believe this. First celebrity death that's actually made me sad. How is this possible?
https://www.radarbox24.com/data/registration/N72EX
Man we never got a hall of fame speech by Kobe... this is so messed up
"TMZ updated their page, his oldest daughter GiGi was also on board. They were going to her basketball practice. :("
TMZ has reported his daughter Gianna was also onboard. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/
"To honor Kobe the Spurs and Raptors both let the 
**24** second shot clock run out on their first possessions. 
Any more stories about how he was honored today?

I had a shit ton of discord notification that I woke up to saying RIP Kobe from basketball discords I forgot about or haven't muted. I assumed they were simply referencing that LeBron passed his on scoring last night. Never would have imagined that it was something like this. So sad.
"[Staples Center, 5pm](https://imgur.com/QOSRB3z)"
Still breaks my heart.
Just stopping by to pay my respects one last time before this post gets archived.
"Thank you Kobe Bryant. You taught me so much and I'm going to miss you a lot. I'm shocked by your sudden, early passing and I grieve for your friends and family. 

I'm so grateful for your time and energy and everything you brought to me and this world. We didn't always agree and you didn't know me, but I knew a public version of you and I grew to love and respect you for who you were as a genuine individual. You were a special, special talent on the court and everywhere. You were a leader and an innovator who brought so much joy to people's lives. I learned so much from you about basketball, competing, purpose, motivation, balance, self respect, ego, toughness, teamwork, just life... Thank you for sharing yourself with me and the world. It was a true honor. I will carry your lessons with me into the world and a part of my energy will be in honor of yours. Much love."
what the FUCK
Literally sick to my stomach right now
This is not a headline i thought i would scroll across today. Wtf
I’m starting to think helicopters are not the way to go for short convenient trips. A couple of years ago the Leicester City FC owner died flying from his stadium after a match.  Rip
"Helicopter crash confirmed fatalities R.I.P to whoever that was on board, to him or not. 

Fuck his last tweet was to LeBron telling him to move the game forward. He has to for sure now 🌹🌹💐💐"
his poor wife. Fuck. That ain’t fair man
Just confirmed his 13 year old was with him Rip.
"TMZ confirmed one other passenger was confirmed, John Altobelli. I would assume his daughter, 12 or 13 year old Alyssa Altobelli, who [according to this article](https://2paragraphs.com/2019/10/lakers-coach-says-kobe-bryants-daughter-young-killa-in-the-making/) has played with 'Gigi' Bryant in the past, was the other passenger, as they were headed to practice together.

Now here's the thing. Kobe has been known to fly his own helicopters. Whether or not he was the pilot is yet to be confirmed. If he is, I imagine another member of the Altobelli family was involved.

Alyssa Altobelli is in [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzgVg4JFXsN/?utm_source=ig_embed)."
This is gonna be the top all-time /r/NBA post and it just fills me with so much sadness.
2020 can go suck a shaq sized dick
This still doesn’t feel real y’all. What a horrible day.
R.I.P Gianna ❤️❤️❤️
"Never been more affected by an athlete/celebrity/icon’s death. Still in shock. Feeling absolutely heartbroken. Rest easy to him and his daughter, and remembering the legacy he left behind."
Woke up this morning hoping yesterday was a bad dream.
Man I'll go a while without thinking about this but then something reminds me of it and then I'm in disbelief all over again.
I don’t think Kobe being dead will ever feel normal for me. I get hazey thinking about it.
"Just found myself stumbling through Kobe highlight videos on YouTube; something I haven't done in a while. When they showed all of these montages of him taking over late in games and icing wins, they showed clips from the end of his last game and I just started crying. It was more of a good cry - like this man was doing this through his entire career, and this motherfucker is really out here hitting 19 food fadeaways to seal a game, and dropping 60 points while doing so. This man was something else, I tell ya."
Still can’t believe it he’s really gone
Nope. A month later and still sad...RIP KOBE+GiGi
What
Please be fake
just horrible. kobe had so much to give the world off the court. what a tragedy.
41 years old just getting started on the 2nd chapter. Horrifying man.
"I’m shook. This is horrible. Survived by four children including a newborn. 

RIP to one of the greatest to ever do it. My thoughts with his family.

Edit: wrote this before the news of his daughter being on the helicopter with him. Unbelievable, this is so sad. 13 years old. Rest In Peace."
I feel sick man 😭
"This doesn’t even feel possible man. A guy we all grew up idolizing taken away too soon. This shit got me broken

Rest In Peace Bean"
"12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13.

TMZ has became more accurate with its new reporting than most major new sources. It showed with the reporting of who else was also on the helicopter
Anyone else shoot stuff into the trash and yell “Kobe”
"I’ve been scrolling social media about this since it happened around 2pm... it’s 4:30 am and I’m still scrolling different social media. I can’t believe this is real. I’ve cried 3-4 times today. This is so random and sudden and at such a young age, with his daughter. 

This took me out. Kobe wasn’t even in my top 5 personal favorite players. I LOVED him during his retirement. When I heard the news I felt like I was shot in the gut. I never met the man or saw him live, but throughout the years of debates watching interviews and watching just games on TV, he really felt like family. Such a genuine guy. Will never feel real to me. #MambaOut....."
Alright who put the wholesome award
Ran 8.24 miles today in honor of him and his daughter❤️
Kobe. Love you.

The more I stew in what happened the more horseshit it becomes. Life isn't fair. Fuck this so fucking much.
We miss you Kobe. Rest in Power
I come back to this thread daily and I’m still in awe. KOBE BRYANT MAN WTF. RIP 💜
still feels unreal
Stop
Holy crap I can only find this from tmz no idea if it's true
TMZ is usually accurate with these reports. This is fucking crazy
"Lakers will win this championship for Kobe. Those guys are going to ball mamba mindset. 
Rip Kobe. Damn. I have feelings it seems. My stomach and my heart hurt"
A competitor and father we can all strive to be. Wow.
Rest in peace
Why did the actual source post get deleted yet a tweet by someone saying the source is reporting this stay up?
I feel so empty. Life is really unpredictable. RIP Kobe.

Remember to keep shouting Kobe when you shoot your garbage to the bin

Don't live your life in fear. If you want to travel in a helicopter or aeroplane then do it. Just be careful and know what to do in the events of a crash or accident."
"So the five are Kobe, a daughter, the pilot, and another teenager player with their parent"
"RIP Kobe. Was wearing a Kobe jersey as I heard the news. So devastating....

We all know, though, that as soon as he got up stairs he challenged the big fella to a one on one."
[Fox News received some information live on air. Gianna’s death was already reported. This sounded bad. ](https://streamable.com/v9see)
Who gave this post a “made me smile” award??
"Not my idea, but seen a few on twitter saying that the allstar game jersey should Kobe #8 Lakers Home and Kobe #24 Lakers Away for the two sides. 

I'd like that. Prob they do a patch though."
It's as though a head of state has died abruptly and it feels like it. I still can't believe and was screaming at the screen at work when it was announced. Kobe set the standard for generations of stars. He just was(I can't even say it because I still can't believe it) Mamba. Kobe forever 🤧 😭
"Just a reminder that this is a time of mourning. You see a celebrity you don't like honoring his memory, don't take it as an opportunity to shit on them. And if for any reason you didn't like Kobe, weren't a fan, or don't want to mourn, for the love of God do **not** bring up shit about how he and his daughter deserved it. It's disrespectful as fuck."
Please tell me they didn’t just say nine instead of five...
"Fuck what a shock RIP Kobe.
EDIT His 13 year old daughter was on board too that's devastating"
"Its hard for me to fathom. Born and raised in LA.. kobe was a god. I remember when i was 8 calling my cousins talking about the lakers making the finals in 2000. Then cried with them when they lost against the pistons. Then jumped for joy when he dropped 81. Then when the lakers went and won in 2009 and 2010. Then cried again when he retired in 2016. Kobe has been my icon since i was baby... and now his chapter has closed.. and i know this experience isn’t just unique to me but all laker fans. 


RIP Kobe Bean Bryant. I love you with all my heart."
I keep reading the title over and over but it doesn’t feel real
RIP Kobe and his little girl and the other families that perished too. It just struck me that we will be deprived of his Hall of Fame speech. So sad for all the families.
As someone that is same age as him and has 3 daughters the same age as him. I feel for his family. I can’t even begin to imagine what they are going thru. My condolences. R.I.P mamba and G.  Somewhere in heaven there is an epic game of one on one going on.
"I know some of the elder statesmen released statements

but i wish there would be some live video remarks from Jordan, kinda like how the president would come on during a national tragedy to give some words of comfort. 

idk, someone to reassure .........its stupid i know, but i would feel better. times like this i know i'm an adult, but deep down i still feel like a scared kid"
"Kareem said something on Instagram. Probably the closest you will get.
."
"I still can't believe he's gone, RIP Kobe"

Still can’t believe it man

Still doesn't seeem real. Big RIP.
I’ll never get over this. Will always be in shock

"Guy predicted this in 2012

[](https://twitter.com/dotNoso/status/268466325842694144?s=07)https://twitter.com/dotNoso/status/268466325842694144?s=07"
Nah he put it up today using an app that lets you change twitter dates (Carbon v2.5). I know this is the case cause Carbonv2.0 came out in 2013. No way he could have posted that beforehand.
ABC is back pedaling on the report that his kids were in the crash. How the fuck do you report something like that without confirming it? Trash.
08/24 should become a city wide holiday in L.A
"I can’t believe it. This fucking sucks. His poor wife and daughters..

Edit: I just found out his daughter Gianna was onboard. My heart breaks for everyone involved. It puts life into perspective, showcasing how chaotic it truly is."
let's hope his daughters weren't on board
"Apparently they weren’t thank goodness

EDIT: WOJ confirmed that his 13 year old daughter Gianna was on the helicopter with him. Absolutely terrible."
"Absolutely. Not that the other four on board makes this any less tragic, of course (and just as much sympathy goes out to them as well). But if it was him and his kids... my God. That'd be absolutely horrible.

Edit: It appears reports are now confirming one of his daughters was on board. Adrian Wojnarowski is also saying that another parent and daughter were accompanying them on their way to a practice. :("
"Many families losing a piece is somehow easier to accept than an entire family checking out at once, or both parents..."
Hence Saving Private Ryan.
Oh yeah. Forgot that was basically the incident
"I'm reading that his daughters were on board. I hope this report is false.

EDIT: Confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was on board as well. None of his other kids were."
"Such a terrifying way to go, too.  Shit."
Absolutely awful seeing as he's been on countless helicopter rides. One of my worst fears is to be on a plane and it just suddenly malfunctions and crashes.
"If it’s worth anything to you, with a large plane, as most of us go on, it’s one of the safest things you could use for transportation. These helicopters and small planes are definitely the highest possibility for aviation crashes though."
"The human brain is weird man. People feel safe and in control in a car on the ground but it’s statistically far far more dangerous than flying, which people are afraid of

edit: alright I fuckin get it, planes have a high fatality rate when they malfunction mid-flight. 50 people already replied it thanks"
"It probably has to do with us thinking because we have control, we'll be fine."
"Also probably because it’s scarier to be 30,000 feet in the air and fall to your death than to get into a car accident"
There was just an accident next to my house. Driver was texting and hit a family. I'd much rather be in a plane where the pilot is highly trained and has to undergo rigorous testing. The only thing keeping you safe when you drive is a yellow line painted on the ground
I think the biggest concern with people is that a fender bender is a bit of whiplash and an insurance call. A plane crash is almost certain death.
"Nah, the data isn't simply comparing being more likely to get in an accident, its literally comparing chance of dying, which is much much higher in cars."
This is one of the reasons that I will never fly in a small plane/helicopter. Something like 95% of all aircraft crashes are these small private craft.
"Small planes are pretty safe - even if the engine dies, they have the highest glide ratios of any aircraft, and can almost always get to somewhere safe to land. When helicopters fail it's a hope and a prayer, despite pilots being trained to autorotate down.

It's why I have zero desire to get into helicopters."
"As a heli pilot myself who has trained to do auto rotations and have been with pilots who can do it with their eyes closed, I can tell you that the pilot that flew for someone of Kobe's stature was probably an elite pilot. Someone who could do autos in their sleep and controlled the helicopter like a puppet. Even so, when shit goes wrong on a heli, even the best of the best can't do much once you start to fking spin and lose all control. It's fucked up."
What are some of the possible situations that can happen that lead to spinning out of control?  Is something like that occurring more likely to be due to weather conditions or a mechanical failure?
"Highest probable causal factors considering the low vis/fog in the area (in order of likelihood):

1. Vertigo (pilot's perception of up/down/left/right didn't match reality)
2. Obstacles (tower, power line, or rising mountain terrain obscured by low visibility)
3. CFIT (Controlled flight into terrain, aka pilot doesn't notice constant steady rate descent or rising terrain)
4. Loss of Tail Rotor Drive

Likely you have a little of column 1 and column 2 which led to column 3"
helicoptering to me never seems in control. you're fighting constant changing variables. Fuck that.
LSU's OC daughter in law died in a small plane crash too.
"A plane can and will glide for awhile, a plane *wants* to fly.  A helicopter...does not."
A helicopter can autorotate and land safely with no power
Life is so weird.
"“12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13.
We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks."
It has to be... god damn
Ny post verified Kobe was on board as well.
"I hope his family wasn't in the helicopter...but if that's true, that still means some other folks died. This is so sad."
"A reporter on ABC just made it seem like his family was on the helicopter with him, but it didn’t feel like they hey had it confirmed. It was a weird report and if inaccurate hugely unprofessional. I hope his daughters are ok."
was Kobe the pilot of the helicopter?
"~~He was a certified pilot in case of emergency, but I highly doubt he was the usual pilot.~~ Everything I've seen says there was an onboard fire and, depending on where it was, there is fuck all you can do about that.

Edit: I've been corrected about him being a pilot."
wonder how the fire started
"He is not a certified pilot.

https://amsrvs.registry.faa.gov/airmeninquiry/Main.aspx"
"No he hired a personal pilot. 

The helicopter he usually flew on was a Robinson R44 I think which are popular for training but unique from other Helis due to using a flat 4 piston engine instead of a turbine. They’re also know for having many deadly crashes from defective rotor blades and weak fuel tank design like passengers could survive the impact but fuel tank breaks engulfing the survives in flames"
If it's known for the failures why are they still made?
It was actually a Sikorsky S-76B confirmed by the heli-association. Reason for crash is unknown
"Don’t think so, it caught fire and that’s how it crashed"
"Fuuuck... That would be scary, RIP Kobe."
"It’s not really appropriate but I always wonder how people react in those last minutes.

Do they freak out like most of us? Are they as cool under pressure as they are when they’re down by 2 with 0:04 remaining. I know we’ll never know but I always like to pretend in moments like that, they are the exact same as we remember them."
"I can't stop thinking about the same thing. I've buried far too many friends in the last 3 years, and for some reason there last thoughts/words are always what I think about most.

I honestly feel like it shakes me up even more thinking Kobe was just stone faced and calm throughout all this. The man was a human, which was/is easy to forget when you've looked up to him as something bigger than life for over a decade. I can't handle/process the idea of Mamba Kobe going down at the moment.

As terrible as it is that him and his daughter passed, I hope that they were at least able to comfort each other in there final moments. It's all we can really hope for right now."
"I often spend more time wondering about things like that. Did they have time to comfort each other? Or was it a very sudden—things were fine, then they weren’t, and it’s over type—situation?

I know we will most likely never know. I had family on the Air France 447 flight that went down in between Brazil and France. The pilot’s instruments froze and he pulled up, taking the plane into a very slow, apparently almost unnoticeable stall. Over the years I have spoken with many flight engineers who said my sister would probably have had no idea what was happening and didn’t feel anything when she went. I always pray that was true."
"Your sister was on Air France 447? Damn, that is rough. For what it is worth from a complete stranger on the interwebs, I can tell you that those flight engineers you spoke to are 110% correct with what they told you. None of the passengers knew anything was about to happen because the plane was in a stall, not a dive, and it was instantaneous. 

Now, Kobe’s crash, holy shit, it seems that he may have had quite a bit of time before his death, 10 seconds at least, up to a minute if the chopper was at a higher altitude. Brutal man, absolutely brutal."
"What wrenches my heart is what went through his mind knowing his daughter was going to die. I'm not saying I'd be cool and collected facing my own death, but as a father, just thinking of my daughter also dying is horrific. This is what's eating me up right now."
Yeah man. I have a two year old daughter and another kid on the way. I immediately went and gave my wife and little one the biggest hug possible. Shit really is different when you have kids.
"Losing a game won't end your life, they freak out like all of us and panic too."
Many people are calm before death
"Yeah I can see him being calm before death but the fact that his daughter was on it, he was definitely freaking out."
"Yeah, I can't imagine what he was feeling, knowing his daughter was going to die beside him. So incredibly sad."
Probly just held his daughter
What else could you do. Death is inevitable. At least they had each other in the end.
"I dunno, I was in a car that rolled down a hill and once we started flipping over I pretty much just accepted whatever was going to happen. Your body doesn’t bother panicking when you know there’s nothing you can do."
"It’s not inappropriate, death conjures weird feelings and makes us think deeply about things like this.. wanting know how someone reacts in they’re last moments may come off as *insensitive to those more closely attached to the situation but it’s perfectly naturally to be having those thoughts.. I’m sure the Mamba’s up there helping god improve his baseline post fade."
"Thanks. That means a lot, Internet friend."
"Literally was having this discussion when that plane in Iran went down. Horrifying way to go, imagine those last few seconds of your life, literally out of your control & nothing you can do. I pray to never experience this.


RIP"
His 13 year old daughter died with him too. Life sucks
Holy shit I can’t actually believe what I am reading. I’m in shock
"My heart is beating out of my chest. I’ve lived in LA my whole life, this guy was LA. We’re going to be mourning this for a long time."
Forever man I still can’t believe it. It’s like I lost a family.
"Everyone i know is in tears and can’t comprehend that this is real. We’re all in our 30s and so Kobe has been a big part of our lives, BIG. I just don’t even have the words"
Same. Idk how to feel.
This would be tragic
Tragic is an understatement.

FUCK
I just can't imagine Kobe not being around. This is one of the biggest moments in sports history outside of the game
"I barely know an NBA without Kobe, I figured he’d be one of those elder statesmen being courtside and around the game for decades to come"
He would’ve and should’ve been... fuck man
His poor family
It breaks for my heart for his kids. Just had one in June. Unbelievable. I can't believe this what the actual fuck.
"Yeah i was just thinking about his daughters. He was always so involved with them, he always talked about them like they were his world. God, even just saying ""was"" feels wrong"
He absolutely would have been. He loved the game like no one else.
Like we just saw him congratulate Lebron. I thought I would see Kobe around basketball for most of my life but he's suddenly just gone.
I'm in full blown denial.
"I barely know an NBA without Kobe, I figured he’d be one of those elder statesmen being courtside and around the game for decades to come"
"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas

this will be the sports equivalent of Princess Diana’s death.
"This is absolutely crazy, it's fucking surreal"
It cant be real
"Unfortunately, reports look like it's real. Holy smokes."
That's a spot on analogy. Fucking crazy news.
I’ll probably never forget this moment the rest of my life. Was about to jack off and checked reddit real quick and damn
I think the sports equivalent of that would be like kobe dying during his prime or something. This is still terrible but a little different
"Nah, especially since we saw a glimpse of Kobe’s post playing career, there is no doubt he is was going to remain well in the public eye with all
His off court work"
"I dunno about that - Diana's death had a lot of outside context where the paparazzi that hounded her was largely responsible.

This is a terrible, unexpected tragedy and I don't mean to lessen or undermine your grief, I just want to mention there was more to Diana's death.

**EDIT:** To be a little more constructive, I would liken this more to Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens' plane going down."
I’m shook.
More than shook. What the fuck
I'm so fucking shaken right now
I think its true holy FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!! REST IN PEACE
"Not often that you have to open breaking news with ""not a joke""."
Sad truth about the bullshit social media times we live in...this is fucking crazy
"That's true but this is also one of those stories that is SO out there and unexpected, it's 100% natural to doubt it at first regardless of the source.   Fucking crazy man, this is some Steve Prefontaine shit."
I’m numb. What do you do? Kobe was such an influence and icon to so many fans let alone the players. I think the NBA needs to take a couple days to let the league come to grips and deal with this loss. Fuck man
No one would risk their reputation reporting this kind of news if it weren't true. I can't believe it too but I'm genuinely aching man.
"My fondest memory playing youth basketball was getting to play one on one with Kobe when he visited the Army post I lived on in Korea as a kid. He was such a big part of my love for basketball growing up, this shit hits hard even though I didn’t know him."
"Despite the shallow gossip stuff they usually cover, TMZ is surprisingly reliable with reporting, mainly because they know celebrities would sue the hell out of them for libel if they misreported something. Sadly, I think this is true."
"Fuck, this hits hard. One of my childhood idols. Can't believe this"
"Just confirmed by ABC7 in LA. He's gone. RIP Mamba

Edit: just confirmed by TMZ that his daughter GiGi was also on board. Awful"

"Helicopters and small aircrafts are super useful and fast but they have a huge risk that if anything goes wrong death is very likely — a soccer player called sala also died in a small plane but there was very careless pilot error


It’s sad seeing young people die in tragic accidents especially entertainers who provided joy and motivation to millions 

Life goes on and everybody has to move on but it’s good to grieve for a short time period the loss of some inspiring people 

Helicopters are just too unsafe to use as a daily thing really"
"> a soccer player called sala also died in a small plane

Plus Roberto Clemente, Thurman Munson"
"I understand being rich and wanting to have your own aircraft and stuff, but I don’t know that I’d ever trust it no matter how much I make. Too many people have died from private aircraft accidents."
"They’re still quite safe, statistically speaking- you just absolutely cannot skip on maintenance like you can with cars (NOT SAYING KOBE DID)"
Compared to commercial airplanes though it's manyfolds less safe
"Colin McCrae, Davey Allison..."
"Not true. Helicopters are much safer then fixed wing aircraft when it comes to emergencies, if operated by a well trained pilot. As an air traffic controller, I've personally had 2 helicopters in my short career that I've been talking to declare an emergency and walk away without safe to the aircraft. This is due to a procedure called autorotation. 

An autorotation is a recovery maneuver where the pilot can force a short, brief rotation of the rotor causing a surge of lift. In one of my examples, a helicopter rapidly lost oil pressure and declared an emergency and aimed to set down in a field. Thanks to the autorotation, he was able to safely (but roughly) land the aircraft with no injuries. He even flew it out less then 3 hours later after preforming an oil change. Now, if that had been a fixed wing aircraft I would be discussing a tragedy. Where that pilot landed was nothing but sheer sea cliffs and dirt roads. His only option would be an attempted sea landing which often times proves fatal.

Helicopter pilots practice autorotations relentlessly at my former airport, and watching autorotations was always so cool. You see the helicopter nose down and speed towards the ground only at the last second to recover and avoid the ground. I'd fly in a helicopter over an airplane any day of the week."

I can't even believe it. This doesn't even feel possible. What the fuck.
Yeah my brain does not compute. Like everything points to it being a real story but I literally can't believe it.
"I’m devastated, man. Just devastated."
"I wasn't even a Lakers fan but this is just so so so so depressing. He's done so much for basketball. I feel so bad for his daughter and family in general, he was such a great dad :(

Edit: Tmz just confirmed his daughter was on the helicopter as well. Fuck :("
"Man, he was always supposed to be one of my enemies as a Celtics fan but i could never bring myself to disliking him. What the fuck. This is so fucking upsetting"
This is hard to accept for real
2020 is off to an incredibly insane start and January isn’t even over yet.
"I feel you. I’m heartbroken. Not a Kobe fan, not a Lakers fan. Doesn’t matter. Wife and 4 daughters, was only 41...it’s just devastating. Feel like I need to go call my mom."
"I’m in Sydney, it’s 6:45am my brother ran into my room telling me. I just don’t know. I flew all the way to Cleveland to watch him vs Bron..."
Kobe felt untouchable
"It feels like a fucking shitty generated story from a game or something.

WHAT THE FUCK? NO! We were supposed to have 50 years of his old man banter with Lebron! 

Fucking WHAT???"
"I’m completely shook right now.

Grew up watching him."
It's so out of the fucking blue. Truly shocking and terribly sad.
"at the gas pump and the woman next to me is ~~balling~~ bawling. 

This is awful.

Edit: fixed it ya jerks lol. Fuck though."
It's what Kobe would want
"Lol fuck you for making me laugh right now.

Seriously though, thanks for this."
 #mambamentality
Fuck you for making me laugh at that.
You have to laugh at death
wtf man.  This is crazy.  That is so sad.
What the fuck man this has to be fake
Vanessa went private on Instagram so I think it may be true unfortunately
i’m literally in shock
I can't even process that this is real.
Can't even process this really doesn't make sense
Man what the actual fuck
I just can't believe it!
"Twitter’s broken, searching up “Kobe” won’t load anything"
I think Twitter broke.
His article on wikipedia has crashed to because all of the traffic.
"As someone who avoids twitter, can someone please explain why they’d do this?"
"I don't think they turned it off, it just broke due to high traffic."
He seemed like one of those guys that would just be around forever
"NBA greats tend to stay forever. We still have Bill Russell, for Christ's sake."
I know black doesn’t crack but he just always looked so young to me. Like he’d be around spreading his nba wisdom until the heat death of the universe
It's not like he was 60. He just retired a few years ago.
"I kind of never considered the possibility that Kobe was a mortal who *could* even die. He was like the timeless, ubiquitous embodiment of basketball. Fuck."
Yeah it sounds made up. Completely out of the blue.
"Its probably true. La times article about a crash in calabasas posted 30 min before Tmz https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas

edit: It's been confirmed by multiple sources now. Woj confirmed it as well. https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?s=19"
Jesus Christ I feel like I’m about to throw up
"This will be the biggest ""celebrity death"" for me, it's fucking crazy"
It’s just so out of the  blue. If he was getting really old then you kinda have the time to mentally prepare yourself but a sudden crash at 41 years old? Fuck man
"Bruh what really gets me is that before the game last night, me and my friends were discussing if LeBron was gonna take his foot off the pedal against the Sixers so that he could pass Kobe in scroing vs the Clippers in LA in front of a ""home"" crowd.

Now imagine if that had been the case"
"Like, if this happened when he was 70... It would be ""easier"". But just four years ago he was dropping 60 points. Fuck me.

RIP Mamba. One of the very best."
I've been a Kobe hater basically my whole life and I feel the same way. Can't even imagine what a gut punch this news must be for Lakers fans.
This is a gut punch for anyone that's a basketball fan. This is so fucking awful.
I am fucking destroyed right now.
"https://twitter.com/latimes/status/1221517388056629248

Edit: Police has confirmed to variety https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/kobe-bryant-dead-helicopter-crash-lakers-1203480844/

Also Local ABC, ESPN... fuck man"
At this point he would have spoken up had he not been in the crash
It's surreal it's something that I just don't want to believe.  This is the first celebrity death that hits so close to home.
Holy fucking shit. I hate that I want this to be fake but TMZ is never wrong about celebrity deaths...
Tmz is a reliable source. This is fucking insane.
I wish it was any other outlet. TMZ more reliable than Reuters about this kind of thing. I’m in shock.
"This fucking sucks.

Edit: There should be a second black bar on jerseys for the remainder of the season. He meant so much to the game and the modern NBA. Again, this fucking sucks."
I don’t even think I have feelings yet. Total shock. Seems fake but I know it’s not.
Same. I can't even think right now
"This doesn’t feel real. Like I know it is, but it doesn’t feel real."
"It feels like a stupid ass rumor that will get disproven... it’s stunning. But I know TMZ doesn’t fuck around with this shit

If it’s really true, RIP Kobe."
"They broke the news about Paul Walker as well, right? Man I hope this is not true.."
They broke news about Juices death too. He’s gone.... RIP to a goat
And MJ way back
Michael Jackson
"Yeah, TMZ is probably the most legit source in the world when it comes to celebrities of different kinds, they wouldnt put something like this out there if it wasnt 100% true.

fuuuuuuuck man, this cant be happening, this is the biggest celebrity to die since Michael Jackson, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This was so out of the blue, what the fuck..."
I swear I legitimately feel sick. Celebrity deaths don’t usually even affect me that much. Jesus Christ.
"Still feel like this is fake, but it's TMZ...man this is so fucked up..."
"> Celebrity deaths don’t usually even affect me that much.

Most celebrities aren't watched for 2-3 hours 82-100 times per year for 20 years. For many, Kobe was as central a piece of their living room as their sofa."
TMZ is reliable af for celebrity death news
Yes. I still remember the day they were the first announcing Michael Jacksons death.
"Yep and everybody was waiting for a “more reliable” source. 

TMZ is on top of its celebrity passing game."
"And this is something you don’t want to be wrong on, because if they were to be wrong, that’s a death knell"
TMZ usually gets it right on celebrity deaths.
"Yeah. And this is the kind of thing where if they got it wrong, their erroneously reporting it will be a *huge* deal and a massive black eye for them.

Really hope they got it wrong, though."
"There's no way they would run this if they weren't almost 100% sure. 

They're wrong a lot but usually about menial shit like when GSP retired from MMA and they speculated it was because he had a baby with his secret girlfriend"
This is a punch to the gut. Sudden deaths are the worst.
He was such a young person still as well. The thought of a guy like him dying in the near future never even felt like a real possibility.
i remember they broke michael jackson's death first. they're pretty reliable unfortunately
Looks like it just happened. I’m shocked.
I dont want to believe it either. We need confirmation. I literally want to cry it's so random and cruel.
Fuck. His poor family. This is awful.
"Fuck, heartbreaking"
"This is the first athlete’s death that I watched as a kid, my heart feels empty right now."
I just got on break at work and I’m fucking shook
That’s how I feel man. My childhood was based around basketball and Kobe and the Lakers was such a huge huge part of that. I truly never understood the heartache behind celebrity deaths but I do now.
This is the most shocking and saddening death since Michael.
Anthony Bourdain's death really fucked me up.
"Prince, for me."
Damn man I hope you'll be okay.
I'm sorry for your loss
"> his final 2016 game

Man, that wasn't even that long ago. Dude was still in the early years of his retirement with so much ahead of him."
Right? I remember that night so vividly. I remember Kanye posting his ticket and saying he couldn’t wait to see mamba’s last game. Time flies time flies
"I was flicking back and forth between the Warriors 73rd win and Kobe’s last game. Ultimately, couldn’t miss that 4th quarter Kobe"
he congratulated lebron and said he wanted to be there when he passed him just like jordan was for him. fuck man
What the fuckkkkk
This is one of the most surreal deaths of a famous person. I’m still in shock. This just doesn’t make sense holy shit
"Aside from the grief of his family, I can’t imagine how Lebron might feel about this. Kobe was supporting him all the way. From one legend to another. This fucking sucks. Thoughts out to his family."
Don't think so
I don't think he was and you can't really fly a helicopter cross country? It says it happened in Calabasas which well north of Newport Beach where he lives? Could be just visiting friends up there or something
"One of the greatest athletes our species has ever produced. 


He was just incredibly... special."
"Man same. Started playing ball because Kobe was out there tearing it up every night, and I watched in awe when he dropped those 60 on his last game, inspired the new generation and was shaping up to become a legend off the court as well... I’m in tears rn"
"Keep carrying on Mamba's legacy, man."
"I'm shook and I wasn't even a Laker fan. Loved his killer instinct and work ethic. A brilliant mind too. I was looking forward to his basketball commentary for DECADES to come! So awful, I feel sick."
"What was the registration? N76EX? I'm buddies with the Chief pilot of that company and he's not answering his phone. I'm praying he wasn't the one flying.

Edit: it was him"
"Hope everything turns out ok with your friend. 

https://twitter.com/bdp473/status/1221502829245763584?s=21"
I've flown 72EX (not with Kobe in it). Hope it wasn't my guy. Great pilot thousands of house. You hate to see it man
"Apparently there was an onboard fire before they crashed. Even with thousands of verified flight hours, there are some unforeseen circumstances that will kill you, no matter how experienced you are."
That makes more sense than what I initially thought was an engine failure. The Sikorsky has two engines so unless both failed simultaneously they wouldn't have slammed into the ground.
"Oh god, I don’t think I’m gonna be able to watch that. I’ll end up as a wreck trying to watch that"
"Another reminder that rich or poor, powerful or powerless us humans or life for that matter is a blink away from being gone from this world.
So sad."
Real life kinda sucks :/
"Reality is stranger than fiction sometimes man, not even 24 hours after he gives his blessing to Bron and Bron hyping him up for 4 mins after the game"
This shit is crazy. I honestly cant believe it.
Theres just something so poetic about that being the last thing he ever said to the public
He is only 41 years old wtf man
No one would even want to write that shit.
I don't want to be reading this shit. Fuck me man. I barely know an NBA without him around.
[Kobe's last tweet ever](https://twitter.com/kobebryant/status/1221276426164269056)
I really hope it’s the last one and nobody takes over. It’s surreal that was his last tweet
"This is the absolute lowest I've ever felt as an NBA fan.  

As much as I hated him torching my team, I grew into an adult watching him play.

It's like having your heart ripped out, man."
I just feel a mixture of emptiness and confusion. My mind can't even process the fact that this is all happening. It doesn't feel real.
I just assumed he'd be with us and active in the sport decades into the future like a Bill Russell type of figure.  This is just so depressing.
This and Len Bias are terrible tragedies. My heart goes out to his family and his four daughters. Literal just had another daughter too. So tragic.
"> This and Len Bias are terrible tragedies.

Drazen Petrovic as well."
Unfortunately TMZ is super reliable on this stuff...damnnnnn!!!!!
"It's gotta be real. Here's a tweet with Kobe and his helicopter - an S76  [https://twitter.com/sikorsky/status/720670572477358081?lang=en](https://twitter.com/sikorsky/status/720670572477358081?lang=en)

and this article posted an hour earlier mentions that the helicopter that crashed was an s76. Then TMZ I guess was able to confirm that Kobe was inside.

[https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/01/26/aircraft-reported-down-in-calabasas-no-word-on-injuries-or-deaths/](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/01/26/aircraft-reported-down-in-calabasas-no-word-on-injuries-or-deaths/)

Edit: Woj confirms it  [https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?s=19](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?s=19)"
Fuck
Wtf could’ve happened to the helicopter for it to crash? this is crazy
"Being reported as ""foggy conditions"". We could speculate until we're blue in the face at this point, but the reports of both ""foggy conditions"" and ""crashing into hillside"" seem to line up to they ran into the side of a hill/mountain because the pilot(s) had really low visibility causing a low amount of time to react."
"Helicopters, like most aircraft, are very reliable and safe compared to automobiles. But when they do go down the chances of surviving a crash are slim to none."
I thought I always heard helicopters were really dangerous and it doesn't take a lot to make them crash.
TMZ is usually pretty accurate with celebrities deaths sadly
"It’s kinda crazy how good TMZ is at reporting about important things. They have a lot of good exclusives, sadly in this case"
It’s cause they pay the most for the story
"tmz surprisingly aren’t typically wrong about stuff like this. what the fuck

edit: https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas

looks like a second source..."
Can’t posting this kind of news without confirmation. It would ruin tmz
TMZ is usually pretty legit about this kind of stuff. Jesus Christ.
Fuck 2020
Sadly it looks like it
"> What’s your relationship with death?

>A comfortable one.

>Yeah?

>It’s a comfortable one. It’s an understanding. You can’t have life without death. Can’t have light without the dark. So it’s an acceptance of that. When it came time to decide whether or not I should retire, [it was] really an acceptance of that mortality that all athletes face. And if you combat it, you’ll always have that inner struggle within yourself. … So … I’m comfortable with it.

Wow..."
"He lived a full life. Honestly the saddest part of all of this is his daughter was there with him. I can’t imagine how he felt when that heli was going down... probably just wished it was only him and not her. 

I really hope there’s something after death and that they’re together right now."
Fuck....just....damn
"Actually crying while reading this, thank you for the link."
"> indicted into the HOF

Um, wrong word choice there."
This is one of the most devastating sports deaths of our lifetime.  Truly unbelievable.
"I can’t think of anybody recently who has died, while they were young, who was honestly in the mention of greatest scorer ever.

This is gonna be THE most devastating sports death in the last 30 years."
"thank you for the humor, i needed that ❤️"
He was already trending on twitter prior to this. I can't believe the timing with LeBron passing him just yesterday. RIP Kobe!
"That was what I thought, saw RIP Kobe trending and my immediate thought was it was just people memeing about LeBron passing him on the scoring list. Jesus Christ."
"That was what I thought too -- someone texted me ""Kobe may have just died"" and it seemed like a joke about him being mad at LeBron. The first stories that pop up on Google are still about the scoring list."
I will never process this
That’s the only right thing to do.
I remember when Paul Pierce shitting his pants was top all time
TMZ is usually accurate with these reports. This is fucking crazy
"Kareem said something on Instagram. Probably the closest you will get.
."
"The estimated price of awards on this submission is $778.53. This is the #3 highest priced submission I have seen.

Y'all wildin
Nah he put it up today using an app that lets you change twitter dates (Carbon v2.5). I know this is the case cause Carbonv2.0 came out in 2013. No way he could have posted that beforehand.
let's hope his daughters weren't on board
"Apparently they weren’t thank goodness

EDIT: WOJ confirmed that his 13 year old daughter Gianna was on the helicopter with him. Absolutely terrible."
"Absolutely. Not that the other four on board makes this any less tragic, of course (and just as much sympathy goes out to them as well). But if it was him and his kids... my God. That'd be absolutely horrible.

Edit: It appears reports are now confirming one of his daughters was on board. Adrian Wojnarowski is also saying that another parent and daughter were accompanying them on their way to a practice. :("
"Many families losing a piece is somehow easier to accept than an entire family checking out at once, or both parents..."
Hence Saving Private Ryan.
Oh yeah. Forgot that was basically the incident
"I'm reading that his daughters were on board. I hope this report is false.

EDIT: Confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was on board as well. None of his other kids were."
Absolutely awful seeing as he's been on countless helicopter rides. One of my worst fears is to be on a plane and it just suddenly malfunctions and crashes.
"If it’s worth anything to you, with a large plane, as most of us go on, it’s one of the safest things you could use for transportation. These helicopters and small planes are definitely the highest possibility for aviation crashes though."
"The human brain is weird man. People feel safe and in control in a car on the ground but it’s statistically far far more dangerous than flying, which people are afraid of

edit: alright I fuckin get it, planes have a high fatality rate when they malfunction mid-flight. 50 people already replied it thanks"
"It probably has to do with us thinking because we have control, we'll be fine."
"Also probably because it’s scarier to be 30,000 feet in the air and fall to your death than to get into a car accident"
There was just an accident next to my house. Driver was texting and hit a family. I'd much rather be in a plane where the pilot is highly trained and has to undergo rigorous testing. The only thing keeping you safe when you drive is a yellow line painted on the ground
I think the biggest concern with people is that a fender bender is a bit of whiplash and an insurance call. A plane crash is almost certain death.
"Nah, the data isn't simply comparing being more likely to get in an accident, its literally comparing chance of dying, which is much much higher in cars."
This is one of the reasons that I will never fly in a small plane/helicopter. Something like 95% of all aircraft crashes are these small private craft.
"Small planes are pretty safe - even if the engine dies, they have the highest glide ratios of any aircraft, and can almost always get to somewhere safe to land. When helicopters fail it's a hope and a prayer, despite pilots being trained to autorotate down.

It's why I have zero desire to get into helicopters."
"As a heli pilot myself who has trained to do auto rotations and have been with pilots who can do it with their eyes closed, I can tell you that the pilot that flew for someone of Kobe's stature was probably an elite pilot. Someone who could do autos in their sleep and controlled the helicopter like a puppet. Even so, when shit goes wrong on a heli, even the best of the best can't do much once you start to fking spin and lose all control. It's fucked up."
What are some of the possible situations that can happen that lead to spinning out of control?  Is something like that occurring more likely to be due to weather conditions or a mechanical failure?
"Highest probable causal factors considering the low vis/fog in the area (in order of likelihood):

1. Vertigo (pilot's perception of up/down/left/right didn't match reality)
2. Obstacles (tower, power line, or rising mountain terrain obscured by low visibility)
3. CFIT (Controlled flight into terrain, aka pilot doesn't notice constant steady rate descent or rising terrain)
4. Loss of Tail Rotor Drive

Likely you have a little of column 1 and column 2 which led to column 3"
helicoptering to me never seems in control. you're fighting constant changing variables. Fuck that.
LSU's OC daughter in law died in a small plane crash too.
"A plane can and will glide for awhile, a plane *wants* to fly.  A helicopter...does not."
A helicopter can autorotate and land safely with no power
"A reporter on ABC just made it seem like his family was on the helicopter with him, but it didn’t feel like they hey had it confirmed. It was a weird report and if inaccurate hugely unprofessional. I hope his daughters are ok."
"~~He was a certified pilot in case of emergency, but I highly doubt he was the usual pilot.~~ Everything I've seen says there was an onboard fire and, depending on where it was, there is fuck all you can do about that.

Edit: I've been corrected about him being a pilot."
wonder how the fire started
"He is not a certified pilot.

https://amsrvs.registry.faa.gov/airmeninquiry/Main.aspx"
"No he hired a personal pilot. 

The helicopter he usually flew on was a Robinson R44 I think which are popular for training but unique from other Helis due to using a flat 4 piston engine instead of a turbine. They’re also know for having many deadly crashes from defective rotor blades and weak fuel tank design like passengers could survive the impact but fuel tank breaks engulfing the survives in flames"
If it's known for the failures why are they still made?
It was actually a Sikorsky S-76B confirmed by the heli-association. Reason for crash is unknown
"Don’t think so, it caught fire and that’s how it crashed"
"Fuuuck... That would be scary, RIP Kobe."
"I can't stop thinking about the same thing. I've buried far too many friends in the last 3 years, and for some reason there last thoughts/words are always what I think about most.

I honestly feel like it shakes me up even more thinking Kobe was just stone faced and calm throughout all this. The man was a human, which was/is easy to forget when you've looked up to him as something bigger than life for over a decade. I can't handle/process the idea of Mamba Kobe going down at the moment.

As terrible as it is that him and his daughter passed, I hope that they were at least able to comfort each other in there final moments. It's all we can really hope for right now."
"I often spend more time wondering about things like that. Did they have time to comfort each other? Or was it a very sudden—things were fine, then they weren’t, and it’s over type—situation?

I know we will most likely never know. I had family on the Air France 447 flight that went down in between Brazil and France. The pilot’s instruments froze and he pulled up, taking the plane into a very slow, apparently almost unnoticeable stall. Over the years I have spoken with many flight engineers who said my sister would probably have had no idea what was happening and didn’t feel anything when she went. I always pray that was true."
"Your sister was on Air France 447? Damn, that is rough. For what it is worth from a complete stranger on the interwebs, I can tell you that those flight engineers you spoke to are 110% correct with what they told you. None of the passengers knew anything was about to happen because the plane was in a stall, not a dive, and it was instantaneous. 

Now, Kobe’s crash, holy shit, it seems that he may have had quite a bit of time before his death, 10 seconds at least, up to a minute if the chopper was at a higher altitude. Brutal man, absolutely brutal."
"What wrenches my heart is what went through his mind knowing his daughter was going to die. I'm not saying I'd be cool and collected facing my own death, but as a father, just thinking of my daughter also dying is horrific. This is what's eating me up right now."
Yeah man. I have a two year old daughter and another kid on the way. I immediately went and gave my wife and little one the biggest hug possible. Shit really is different when you have kids.
"Losing a game won't end your life, they freak out like all of us and panic too."
Many people are calm before death
"Yeah I can see him being calm before death but the fact that his daughter was on it, he was definitely freaking out."
"Yeah, I can't imagine what he was feeling, knowing his daughter was going to die beside him. So incredibly sad."
Probly just held his daughter
What else could you do. Death is inevitable. At least they had each other in the end.
"I dunno, I was in a car that rolled down a hill and once we started flipping over I pretty much just accepted whatever was going to happen. Your body doesn’t bother panicking when you know there’s nothing you can do."
"It’s not inappropriate, death conjures weird feelings and makes us think deeply about things like this.. wanting know how someone reacts in they’re last moments may come off as *insensitive to those more closely attached to the situation but it’s perfectly naturally to be having those thoughts.. I’m sure the Mamba’s up there helping god improve his baseline post fade."
"Thanks. That means a lot, Internet friend."
"Literally was having this discussion when that plane in Iran went down. Horrifying way to go, imagine those last few seconds of your life, literally out of your control & nothing you can do. I pray to never experience this.


RIP"
"My heart is beating out of my chest. I’ve lived in LA my whole life, this guy was LA. We’re going to be mourning this for a long time."
Forever man I still can’t believe it. It’s like I lost a family.
"Everyone i know is in tears and can’t comprehend that this is real. We’re all in our 30s and so Kobe has been a big part of our lives, BIG. I just don’t even have the words"
Same. Idk how to feel.
"> Their youngest daughter, Capri, was just born in June 2019.

This hit hard."
Fuck me man.....
The field reporter for the abc news update just said his daughters were on board with him when they cut in on the pro bowl broadcast. I'm hoping that that's just poor reporting on his part...
"No one puts their reputation on the line for news like this.  
Edit: RIP Kobe"
"TMZ have some scummy paparazzi practices, but they're rarely wrong on serious things like this."
Not to mention I'm sure if itd confirmed to be his helicopter I would doubt he wasn't on it.
"TMZ doesn't get this sort of thing wrong

They're tabloid trash for everything except celebrity deaths, where they suddenly become the most reliable media source out there"
I think they reported Lil Wayne had died when he was just hospitalized after a seizure or something. But they're right more often than not. Holding my breath and hoping they're wrong here.
Yeah but there's a big difference between a seizure and a helicopter crash
"TMZ bends the truth all the time for views but they don’t outright lie, because that’s not their thing. They would never make up something like this because they would get sued into oblivion and lose all “credibility” (I know, I know)."
Unfortunately I can't see them take the risk of being wrong about this
I think it's true.  I've always been a Kobe 'hater' and I'm completely shaken up.  This is just so horrible.  R.I.P. Kobe Bryant
Dude I am feeling the same way. Hated on him since I was a kid and shook. Crazy stuff.  Rip.
Tragic is an understatement.
"I barely know an NBA without Kobe, I figured he’d be one of those elder statesmen being courtside and around the game for decades to come"
He would’ve and should’ve been... fuck man
His poor family
It breaks for my heart for his kids. Just had one in June. Unbelievable. I can't believe this what the actual fuck.
"Yeah i was just thinking about his daughters. He was always so involved with them, he always talked about them like they were his world. God, even just saying ""was"" feels wrong"
He absolutely would have been. He loved the game like no one else.
Like we just saw him congratulate Lebron. I thought I would see Kobe around basketball for most of my life but he's suddenly just gone.
I'm in full blown denial.
"I barely know an NBA without Kobe, I figured he’d be one of those elder statesmen being courtside and around the game for decades to come"
"This is absolutely crazy, it's fucking surreal"
It cant be real
"Unfortunately, reports look like it's real. Holy smokes."
That's a spot on analogy. Fucking crazy news.
I’ll probably never forget this moment the rest of my life. Was about to jack off and checked reddit real quick and damn
I think the sports equivalent of that would be like kobe dying during his prime or something. This is still terrible but a little different
"Nah, especially since we saw a glimpse of Kobe’s post playing career, there is no doubt he is was going to remain well in the public eye with all
His off court work"
"I dunno about that - Diana's death had a lot of outside context where the paparazzi that hounded her was largely responsible.

This is a terrible, unexpected tragedy and I don't mean to lessen or undermine your grief, I just want to mention there was more to Diana's death.

**EDIT:** To be a little more constructive, I would liken this more to Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens' plane going down."
Bro I dont even know what to say...
More than shook. What the fuck
Sad truth about the bullshit social media times we live in...this is fucking crazy
"That's true but this is also one of those stories that is SO out there and unexpected, it's 100% natural to doubt it at first regardless of the source.   Fucking crazy man, this is some Steve Prefontaine shit."
"My fondest memory playing youth basketball was getting to play one on one with Kobe when he visited the Army post I lived on in Korea as a kid. He was such a big part of my love for basketball growing up, this shit hits hard even though I didn’t know him."
[Woj confirmed](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221521133608079368?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)
"Man, I'd yell Kobe when doing anything even remotely close to shooting a basket. Still going to."
"Trash can basketball REQUIRES yelling ""KOBE"" when tossing a paper towel away. It's the law"
"> a soccer player called sala also died in a small plane

Plus Roberto Clemente, Thurman Munson"
"I understand being rich and wanting to have your own aircraft and stuff, but I don’t know that I’d ever trust it no matter how much I make. Too many people have died from private aircraft accidents."
"They’re still quite safe, statistically speaking- you just absolutely cannot skip on maintenance like you can with cars (NOT SAYING KOBE DID)"
Compared to commercial airplanes though it's manyfolds less safe
"Colin McCrae, Davey Allison..."
"Not true. Helicopters are much safer then fixed wing aircraft when it comes to emergencies, if operated by a well trained pilot. As an air traffic controller, I've personally had 2 helicopters in my short career that I've been talking to declare an emergency and walk away without safe to the aircraft. This is due to a procedure called autorotation. 

An autorotation is a recovery maneuver where the pilot can force a short, brief rotation of the rotor causing a surge of lift. In one of my examples, a helicopter rapidly lost oil pressure and declared an emergency and aimed to set down in a field. Thanks to the autorotation, he was able to safely (but roughly) land the aircraft with no injuries. He even flew it out less then 3 hours later after preforming an oil change. Now, if that had been a fixed wing aircraft I would be discussing a tragedy. Where that pilot landed was nothing but sheer sea cliffs and dirt roads. His only option would be an attempted sea landing which often times proves fatal.

Helicopter pilots practice autorotations relentlessly at my former airport, and watching autorotations was always so cool. You see the helicopter nose down and speed towards the ground only at the last second to recover and avoid the ground. I'd fly in a helicopter over an airplane any day of the week."
Yeah my brain does not compute. Like everything points to it being a real story but I literally can't believe it.
"I’m devastated, man. Just devastated."
"I wasn't even a Lakers fan but this is just so so so so depressing. He's done so much for basketball. I feel so bad for his daughter and family in general, he was such a great dad :(

Edit: Tmz just confirmed his daughter was on the helicopter as well. Fuck :("
"Man, he was always supposed to be one of my enemies as a Celtics fan but i could never bring myself to disliking him. What the fuck. This is so fucking upsetting"
This is hard to accept for real
2020 is off to an incredibly insane start and January isn’t even over yet.
"I feel you. I’m heartbroken. Not a Kobe fan, not a Lakers fan. Doesn’t matter. Wife and 4 daughters, was only 41...it’s just devastating. Feel like I need to go call my mom."
"I’m in Sydney, it’s 6:45am my brother ran into my room telling me. I just don’t know. I flew all the way to Cleveland to watch him vs Bron..."
Kobe felt untouchable
"It feels like a fucking shitty generated story from a game or something.

WHAT THE FUCK? NO! We were supposed to have 50 years of his old man banter with Lebron! 

Fucking WHAT???"
"I’m completely shook right now.

Grew up watching him."
It's so out of the fucking blue. Truly shocking and terribly sad.
It's what Kobe would want
"Lol fuck you for making me laugh right now.

Seriously though, thanks for this."
 #mambamentality
Fuck you for making me laugh at that.
You have to laugh at death
Vanessa went private on Instagram so I think it may be true unfortunately
"I don't think they turned it off, it just broke due to high traffic."
"NBA greats tend to stay forever. We still have Bill Russell, for Christ's sake."
I know black doesn’t crack but he just always looked so young to me. Like he’d be around spreading his nba wisdom until the heat death of the universe
It's not like he was 60. He just retired a few years ago.
"I kind of never considered the possibility that Kobe was a mortal who *could* even die. He was like the timeless, ubiquitous embodiment of basketball. Fuck."
Jesus Christ I feel like I’m about to throw up
"This will be the biggest ""celebrity death"" for me, it's fucking crazy"
It’s just so out of the  blue. If he was getting really old then you kinda have the time to mentally prepare yourself but a sudden crash at 41 years old? Fuck man
"Bruh what really gets me is that before the game last night, me and my friends were discussing if LeBron was gonna take his foot off the pedal against the Sixers so that he could pass Kobe in scroing vs the Clippers in LA in front of a ""home"" crowd.

Now imagine if that had been the case"
"Like, if this happened when he was 70... It would be ""easier"". But just four years ago he was dropping 60 points. Fuck me.

RIP Mamba. One of the very best."
I've been a Kobe hater basically my whole life and I feel the same way. Can't even imagine what a gut punch this news must be for Lakers fans.
This is a gut punch for anyone that's a basketball fan. This is so fucking awful.
I am fucking destroyed right now.
"https://twitter.com/latimes/status/1221517388056629248

They're working on confirming who was in the crash.

Edit: Police has confirmed to variety https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/kobe-bryant-dead-helicopter-crash-lakers-1203480844/

Also Local ABC, ESPN... fuck man"
At this point he would have spoken up had he not been in the crash
It's surreal it's something that I just don't want to believe.  This is the first celebrity death that hits so close to home.
Holy fucking shit. I hate that I want this to be fake but TMZ is never wrong about celebrity deaths...
I wish it was any other outlet. TMZ more reliable than Reuters about this kind of thing. I’m in shock.
"This fucking sucks.

Edit: There should be a second black bar on jerseys for the remainder of the season. He meant so much to the game and the modern NBA. Again, this fucking sucks."
I don’t even think I have feelings yet. Total shock. Seems fake but I know it’s not.
Same. I can't even think right now
"This doesn’t feel real. Like I know it is, but it doesn’t feel real."
"It feels like a stupid ass rumor that will get disproven... it’s stunning. But I know TMZ doesn’t fuck around with this shit

If it’s really true, RIP Kobe."
"They broke the news about Paul Walker as well, right? Man I hope this is not true.."
They broke news about Juices death too. He’s gone.... RIP to a goat
And MJ way back
Michael Jackson
"Yeah, TMZ is probably the most legit source in the world when it comes to celebrities of different kinds, they wouldnt put something like this out there if it wasnt 100% true.

fuuuuuuuck man, this cant be happening, this is the biggest celebrity to die since Michael Jackson, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This was so out of the blue, what the fuck..."
I swear I legitimately feel sick. Celebrity deaths don’t usually even affect me that much. Jesus Christ.
"Still feel like this is fake, but it's TMZ...man this is so fucked up..."
"> Celebrity deaths don’t usually even affect me that much.

Most celebrities aren't watched for 2-3 hours 82-100 times per year for 20 years. For many, Kobe was as central a piece of their living room as their sofa."
TMZ is reliable af for celebrity death news
Yes. I still remember the day they were the first announcing Michael Jacksons death.
"Yep and everybody was waiting for a “more reliable” source. 

TMZ is on top of its celebrity passing game."
"And this is something you don’t want to be wrong on, because if they were to be wrong, that’s a death knell"
"Yeah. And this is the kind of thing where if they got it wrong, their erroneously reporting it will be a *huge* deal and a massive black eye for them.

Really hope they got it wrong, though."
"There's no way they would run this if they weren't almost 100% sure. 

They're wrong a lot but usually about menial shit like when GSP retired from MMA and they speculated it was because he had a baby with his secret girlfriend"
He was such a young person still as well. The thought of a guy like him dying in the near future never even felt like a real possibility.
"I had that same understanding when Mac Miller died, and I wasn’t even a huge fan of his music."
"That's where I'm at with Kobe. I love basketball and he's a fucking legend, but I wouldn't call myself a Kobe fan. His impact was just so huge tho that this death really rocked me. RIP Kobe"
The first celebrity death to ever impact my life was Robin Williams. Still fucks me up thinking about it today
"Prince, for me."
Right? I remember that night so vividly. I remember Kanye posting his ticket and saying he couldn’t wait to see mamba’s last game. Time flies time flies
"I was flicking back and forth between the Warriors 73rd win and Kobe’s last game. Ultimately, couldn’t miss that 4th quarter Kobe"
What the fuckkkkk
This is one of the most surreal deaths of a famous person. I’m still in shock. This just doesn’t make sense holy shit
"Aside from the grief of his family, I can’t imagine how Lebron might feel about this. Kobe was supporting him all the way. From one legend to another. This fucking sucks. Thoughts out to his family."
"Hope everything turns out ok with your friend. 

https://twitter.com/bdp473/status/1221502829245763584?s=21"
I've flown 72EX (not with Kobe in it). Hope it wasn't my guy. Great pilot thousands of house. You hate to see it man
"Apparently there was an onboard fire before they crashed. Even with thousands of verified flight hours, there are some unforeseen circumstances that will kill you, no matter how experienced you are."
That makes more sense than what I initially thought was an engine failure. The Sikorsky has two engines so unless both failed simultaneously they wouldn't have slammed into the ground.
"Reality is stranger than fiction sometimes man, not even 24 hours after he gives his blessing to Bron and Bron hyping him up for 4 mins after the game"
This shit is crazy. I honestly cant believe it.
Theres just something so poetic about that being the last thing he ever said to the public
I don't want to be reading this shit. Fuck me man. I barely know an NBA without him around.
I really hope it’s the last one and nobody takes over. It’s surreal that was his last tweet
I just feel a mixture of emptiness and confusion. My mind can't even process the fact that this is all happening. It doesn't feel real.
I just assumed he'd be with us and active in the sport decades into the future like a Bill Russell type of figure.  This is just so depressing.
"> This and Len Bias are terrible tragedies.

Drazen Petrovic as well."
Fuck
Wtf could’ve happened to the helicopter for it to crash? this is crazy
"Being reported as ""foggy conditions"". We could speculate until we're blue in the face at this point, but the reports of both ""foggy conditions"" and ""crashing into hillside"" seem to line up to they ran into the side of a hill/mountain because the pilot(s) had really low visibility causing a low amount of time to react."
"Helicopters, like most aircraft, are very reliable and safe compared to automobiles. But when they do go down the chances of surviving a crash are slim to none."
I thought I always heard helicopters were really dangerous and it doesn't take a lot to make them crash.
"It’s kinda crazy how good TMZ is at reporting about important things. They have a lot of good exclusives, sadly in this case"
It’s cause they pay the most for the story
"He lived a full life. Honestly the saddest part of all of this is his daughter was there with him. I can’t imagine how he felt when that heli was going down... probably just wished it was only him and not her. 

I really hope there’s something after death and that they’re together right now."
Fuck....just....damn
"I can’t think of anybody recently who has died, while they were young, who was honestly in the mention of greatest scorer ever.

This is gonna be THE most devastating sports death in the last 30 years."
"That was what I thought, saw RIP Kobe trending and my immediate thought was it was just people memeing about LeBron passing him on the scoring list. Jesus Christ."
"That was what I thought too -- someone texted me ""Kobe may have just died"" and it seemed like a joke about him being mad at LeBron. The first stories that pop up on Google are still about the scoring list."
Y'all wildin
"Apparently they weren’t thank goodness

EDIT: WOJ confirmed that his 13 year old daughter Gianna was on the helicopter with him. Absolutely terrible."
"Absolutely. Not that the other four on board makes this any less tragic, of course (and just as much sympathy goes out to them as well). But if it was him and his kids... my God. That'd be absolutely horrible.

Edit: It appears reports are now confirming one of his daughters was on board. Adrian Wojnarowski is also saying that another parent and daughter were accompanying them on their way to a practice. :("
"Many families losing a piece is somehow easier to accept than an entire family checking out at once, or both parents..."
Hence Saving Private Ryan.
Oh yeah. Forgot that was basically the incident
"I'm reading that his daughters were on board. I hope this report is false.

EDIT: Confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was on board as well. None of his other kids were."
"If it’s worth anything to you, with a large plane, as most of us go on, it’s one of the safest things you could use for transportation. These helicopters and small planes are definitely the highest possibility for aviation crashes though."
"The human brain is weird man. People feel safe and in control in a car on the ground but it’s statistically far far more dangerous than flying, which people are afraid of

edit: alright I fuckin get it, planes have a high fatality rate when they malfunction mid-flight. 50 people already replied it thanks"
"It probably has to do with us thinking because we have control, we'll be fine."
"Also probably because it’s scarier to be 30,000 feet in the air and fall to your death than to get into a car accident"
There was just an accident next to my house. Driver was texting and hit a family. I'd much rather be in a plane where the pilot is highly trained and has to undergo rigorous testing. The only thing keeping you safe when you drive is a yellow line painted on the ground
I think the biggest concern with people is that a fender bender is a bit of whiplash and an insurance call. A plane crash is almost certain death.
"Nah, the data isn't simply comparing being more likely to get in an accident, its literally comparing chance of dying, which is much much higher in cars."
This is one of the reasons that I will never fly in a small plane/helicopter. Something like 95% of all aircraft crashes are these small private craft.
"Small planes are pretty safe - even if the engine dies, they have the highest glide ratios of any aircraft, and can almost always get to somewhere safe to land. When helicopters fail it's a hope and a prayer, despite pilots being trained to autorotate down.

It's why I have zero desire to get into helicopters."
"As a heli pilot myself who has trained to do auto rotations and have been with pilots who can do it with their eyes closed, I can tell you that the pilot that flew for someone of Kobe's stature was probably an elite pilot. Someone who could do autos in their sleep and controlled the helicopter like a puppet. Even so, when shit goes wrong on a heli, even the best of the best can't do much once you start to fking spin and lose all control. It's fucked up."
What are some of the possible situations that can happen that lead to spinning out of control?  Is something like that occurring more likely to be due to weather conditions or a mechanical failure?
"Highest probable causal factors considering the low vis/fog in the area (in order of likelihood):

1. Vertigo (pilot's perception of up/down/left/right didn't match reality)
2. Obstacles (tower, power line, or rising mountain terrain obscured by low visibility)
3. CFIT (Controlled flight into terrain, aka pilot doesn't notice constant steady rate descent or rising terrain)
4. Loss of Tail Rotor Drive

Likely you have a little of column 1 and column 2 which led to column 3"
helicoptering to me never seems in control. you're fighting constant changing variables. Fuck that.
LSU's OC daughter in law died in a small plane crash too.
"A plane can and will glide for awhile, a plane *wants* to fly.  A helicopter...does not."
A helicopter can autorotate and land safely with no power
"Planes want to fly, helicopters don't

Edit: Granted I'm still only a student pilot but I'll take fixed wings and a controlled glide over autorotation in an engine emergency situation any day."
"my dad was an Air Force guy so he's biased towards planes, but he never liked helicopters because ""they break 3 laws of physics just by taking off"". He was kidding (for the most part) when he criticized choppers but I could tell he wouldn't want to fly in one if he didn't have to"
"Helicopter mechanic, can confirm.

""A helicopter is just a million parts, rotating around an oil spill, waiting for metal fatigue to set in""

"" Takeoff is optional, landing is not"""
Yep my dad worked on helicopters for 11 years in the Navy... won't go anywhere near them
I saw a really horrible video of a bride who was en route to her wedding when the helicopter went down. Someone is filming inside the helicopter and it's awful. I'd never set foot on one.
"I had a client who worked in aviation insurance for 30 years and he told me if he could give me one tip that would be to never get in a private helicopter or a hot air balloon. This was years ago, and now every time a accident like this happens i think of that guy."
wonder how the fire started
"He is not a certified pilot.

https://amsrvs.registry.faa.gov/airmeninquiry/Main.aspx"
If it's known for the failures why are they still made?
It was actually a Sikorsky S-76B confirmed by the heli-association. Reason for crash is unknown
"Fuuuck... That would be scary, RIP Kobe."
"I often spend more time wondering about things like that. Did they have time to comfort each other? Or was it a very sudden—things were fine, then they weren’t, and it’s over type—situation?

I know we will most likely never know. I had family on the Air France 447 flight that went down in between Brazil and France. The pilot’s instruments froze and he pulled up, taking the plane into a very slow, apparently almost unnoticeable stall. Over the years I have spoken with many flight engineers who said my sister would probably have had no idea what was happening and didn’t feel anything when she went. I always pray that was true."
"Your sister was on Air France 447? Damn, that is rough. For what it is worth from a complete stranger on the interwebs, I can tell you that those flight engineers you spoke to are 110% correct with what they told you. None of the passengers knew anything was about to happen because the plane was in a stall, not a dive, and it was instantaneous. 

Now, Kobe’s crash, holy shit, it seems that he may have had quite a bit of time before his death, 10 seconds at least, up to a minute if the chopper was at a higher altitude. Brutal man, absolutely brutal."
"What wrenches my heart is what went through his mind knowing his daughter was going to die. I'm not saying I'd be cool and collected facing my own death, but as a father, just thinking of my daughter also dying is horrific. This is what's eating me up right now."
Yeah man. I have a two year old daughter and another kid on the way. I immediately went and gave my wife and little one the biggest hug possible. Shit really is different when you have kids.
Many people are calm before death
"Yeah I can see him being calm before death but the fact that his daughter was on it, he was definitely freaking out."
"Yeah, I can't imagine what he was feeling, knowing his daughter was going to die beside him. So incredibly sad."
Probly just held his daughter
What else could you do. Death is inevitable. At least they had each other in the end.
"I dunno, I was in a car that rolled down a hill and once we started flipping over I pretty much just accepted whatever was going to happen. Your body doesn’t bother panicking when you know there’s nothing you can do."
"Thanks. That means a lot, Internet friend."
Forever man I still can’t believe it. It’s like I lost a family.
"Everyone i know is in tears and can’t comprehend that this is real. We’re all in our 30s and so Kobe has been a big part of our lives, BIG. I just don’t even have the words"
Fuck me man.....
"TMZ have some scummy paparazzi practices, but they're rarely wrong on serious things like this."
Not to mention I'm sure if itd confirmed to be his helicopter I would doubt he wasn't on it.
I think they reported Lil Wayne had died when he was just hospitalized after a seizure or something. But they're right more often than not. Holding my breath and hoping they're wrong here.
Yeah but there's a big difference between a seizure and a helicopter crash
"TMZ bends the truth all the time for views but they don’t outright lie, because that’s not their thing. They would never make up something like this because they would get sued into oblivion and lose all “credibility” (I know, I know)."
"They wouldn’t put stuff like this out if it weren’t true or it would destroy them.

As it’s destroyed me."
Dude I am feeling the same way. Hated on him since I was a kid and shook. Crazy stuff.  Rip.
"I haven't watched or played Basketball in 10 years but Kobe was the one player I used to love watching when I did.

Fuck, this one sucks."
He would’ve and should’ve been... fuck man
His poor family
It breaks for my heart for his kids. Just had one in June. Unbelievable. I can't believe this what the actual fuck.
"Yeah i was just thinking about his daughters. He was always so involved with them, he always talked about them like they were his world. God, even just saying ""was"" feels wrong"
He absolutely would have been. He loved the game like no one else.
Like we just saw him congratulate Lebron. I thought I would see Kobe around basketball for most of my life but he's suddenly just gone.
I'm in full blown denial.
It cant be real
"Unfortunately, reports look like it's real. Holy smokes."
"Nah, especially since we saw a glimpse of Kobe’s post playing career, there is no doubt he is was going to remain well in the public eye with all
His off court work"
"That's true but this is also one of those stories that is SO out there and unexpected, it's 100% natural to doubt it at first regardless of the source.   Fucking crazy man, this is some Steve Prefontaine shit."
I feel like they just have sources within law enforcement and medical systems who are sadly willing to sell out if something happens with a celebrity. ~~Weren't they among the first to report that JPP had gotten maimed by fireworks (when it was supposed to be confidential patient info)?~~ Not to mention all the celebrity death stories they're able to break.
"They do. They have contacts within airports/airlines and stuff too. On top of that I'm pretty sure they pay top dollar for tips, videos, etc, and all that helps explain how they break so many stories of this nature."
"Yeah. People think they're the same as the National Enquirer because their reporting is pretty sleazy, but the Enquirer isn't reliable the way TMZ is."
"Trash can basketball REQUIRES yelling ""KOBE"" when tossing a paper towel away. It's the law"
"They’re still quite safe, statistically speaking- you just absolutely cannot skip on maintenance like you can with cars (NOT SAYING KOBE DID)"
Compared to commercial airplanes though it's manyfolds less safe
"I’m devastated, man. Just devastated."
"I wasn't even a Lakers fan but this is just so so so so depressing. He's done so much for basketball. I feel so bad for his daughter and family in general, he was such a great dad :(

Edit: Tmz just confirmed his daughter was on the helicopter as well. Fuck :("
"Man, he was always supposed to be one of my enemies as a Celtics fan but i could never bring myself to disliking him. What the fuck. This is so fucking upsetting"
This is hard to accept for real
2020 is off to an incredibly insane start and January isn’t even over yet.
"I feel you. I’m heartbroken. Not a Kobe fan, not a Lakers fan. Doesn’t matter. Wife and 4 daughters, was only 41...it’s just devastating. Feel like I need to go call my mom."
"I’m in Sydney, it’s 6:45am my brother ran into my room telling me. I just don’t know. I flew all the way to Cleveland to watch him vs Bron..."
Kobe felt untouchable
"It feels like a fucking shitty generated story from a game or something.

WHAT THE FUCK? NO! We were supposed to have 50 years of his old man banter with Lebron! 

Fucking WHAT???"
"Lol fuck you for making me laugh right now.

Seriously though, thanks for this."
 #mambamentality
Fuck you for making me laugh at that.
You have to laugh at death
Kobe's balling in heaven now :'(
It's not like he was 60. He just retired a few years ago.
"This will be the biggest ""celebrity death"" for me, it's fucking crazy"
It’s just so out of the  blue. If he was getting really old then you kinda have the time to mentally prepare yourself but a sudden crash at 41 years old? Fuck man
"Bruh what really gets me is that before the game last night, me and my friends were discussing if LeBron was gonna take his foot off the pedal against the Sixers so that he could pass Kobe in scroing vs the Clippers in LA in front of a ""home"" crowd.

Now imagine if that had been the case"
"Like, if this happened when he was 70... It would be ""easier"". But just four years ago he was dropping 60 points. Fuck me.

RIP Mamba. One of the very best."
I've been a Kobe hater basically my whole life and I feel the same way. Can't even imagine what a gut punch this news must be for Lakers fans.
This is a gut punch for anyone that's a basketball fan. This is so fucking awful.
I am fucking destroyed right now.
At this point he would have spoken up had he not been in the crash
It's surreal it's something that I just don't want to believe.  This is the first celebrity death that hits so close to home.
"This fucking sucks.

Edit: There should be a second black bar on jerseys for the remainder of the season. He meant so much to the game and the modern NBA. Again, this fucking sucks."
I don’t even think I have feelings yet. Total shock. Seems fake but I know it’s not.
Same. I can't even think right now
"This doesn’t feel real. Like I know it is, but it doesn’t feel real."
"It feels like a stupid ass rumor that will get disproven... it’s stunning. But I know TMZ doesn’t fuck around with this shit

If it’s really true, RIP Kobe."
"They broke the news about Paul Walker as well, right? Man I hope this is not true.."
They broke news about Juices death too. He’s gone.... RIP to a goat
And MJ way back
Michael Jackson
"Yeah, TMZ is probably the most legit source in the world when it comes to celebrities of different kinds, they wouldnt put something like this out there if it wasnt 100% true.

fuuuuuuuck man, this cant be happening, this is the biggest celebrity to die since Michael Jackson, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I swear I legitimately feel sick. Celebrity deaths don’t usually even affect me that much. Jesus Christ.
"Still feel like this is fake, but it's TMZ...man this is so fucked up..."
"> Celebrity deaths don’t usually even affect me that much.

Most celebrities aren't watched for 2-3 hours 82-100 times per year for 20 years. For many, Kobe was as central a piece of their living room as their sofa."
TMZs website is down from all the traffic
Yeah I can't get on the front page. Kobe is an Icon. Im not suprised it had this effect.
"Holy shit this is the most surreal celebrity death Ive ever seen, doesn’t seem like this is even possible"
"I'm convinced this is a dream, like no fucking way. no way man"
Yes. I still remember the day they were the first announcing Michael Jacksons death.
"Yep and everybody was waiting for a “more reliable” source. 

TMZ is on top of its celebrity passing game."
"There's no way they would run this if they weren't almost 100% sure. 

They're wrong a lot but usually about menial shit like when GSP retired from MMA and they speculated it was because he had a baby with his secret girlfriend"
"That's where I'm at with Kobe. I love basketball and he's a fucking legend, but I wouldn't call myself a Kobe fan. His impact was just so huge tho that this death really rocked me. RIP Kobe"
"I was flicking back and forth between the Warriors 73rd win and Kobe’s last game. Ultimately, couldn’t miss that 4th quarter Kobe"
This is one of the most surreal deaths of a famous person. I’m still in shock. This just doesn’t make sense holy shit
what does it say?
“Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother 💪🏾 #33644”
Oh god
"Imagine being Lebron in this scenario, your big brother, the guy you looked up to dies the day after you pass him.

His last tweet was congratulating Lebron..."
I've flown 72EX (not with Kobe in it). Hope it wasn't my guy. Great pilot thousands of house. You hate to see it man
"Apparently there was an onboard fire before they crashed. Even with thousands of verified flight hours, there are some unforeseen circumstances that will kill you, no matter how experienced you are."

"Agreed, especially because they have a baby girl as well."

But still, between this and the Leicester City crash, if I was a big athlete I'd be a bit leery of them at this point.

Wonder what the death stats are vs driving. But even if helis are about as safe it's hard to get past the extra emotional fear of what an air crash must be like."

"Bruh what really gets me is that before the game last night, me and my friends were discussing if LeBron was gonna take his foot off the pedal against the Sixers so that he could pass Kobe in scroing vs the Clippers in LA in front of a ""home"" crowd.

Now imagine if that had been the case"
"Like, if this happened when he was 70... It would be ""easier"". But just four years ago he was dropping 60 points. Fuck me.

RIP Mamba. One of the very best."
This is a gut punch for anyone that's a basketball fan. This is so fucking awful.
I am fucking destroyed right now.
It's surreal it's something that I just don't want to believe.  This is the first celebrity death that hits so close to home.
I don’t even think I have feelings yet. Total shock. Seems fake but I know it’s not.
Same. I can't even think right now
"This doesn’t feel real. Like I know it is, but it doesn’t feel real."
"It feels like a stupid ass rumor that will get disproven... it’s stunning. But I know TMZ doesn’t fuck around with this shit

If it’s really true, RIP Kobe."
They broke news about Juices death too. He’s gone.... RIP to a goat
And MJ way back
Michael Jackson
"Still feel like this is fake, but it's TMZ...man this is so fucked up..."
"> Celebrity deaths don’t usually even affect me that much.

Most celebrities aren't watched for 2-3 hours 82-100 times per year for 20 years. For many, Kobe was as central a piece of their living room as their sofa."
Yeah I can't get on the front page. Kobe is an Icon. Im not suprised it had this effect.
"I'm convinced this is a dream, like no fucking way. no way man"
"Yep and everybody was waiting for a “more reliable” source. 

TMZ is on top of its celebrity passing game."
“Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother 💪🏾 #33644”
Oh god
"Apparently there was an onboard fire before they crashed. Even with thousands of verified flight hours, there are some unforeseen circumstances that will kill you, no matter how experienced you are."
That makes more sense than what I initially thought was an engine failure. The Sikorsky has two engines so unless both failed simultaneously they wouldn't have slammed into the ground.
Theres just something so poetic about that being the last thing he ever said to the public
I thought I always heard helicopters were really dangerous and it doesn't take a lot to make them crash.
"Many families losing a piece is somehow easier to accept than an entire family checking out at once, or both parents..."
Hence Saving Private Ryan.
Oh yeah. Forgot that was basically the incident
"I'm reading that his daughters were on board. I hope this report is false.

EDIT: Confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was on board as well. None of his other kids were."
That’s what I just heard and I was hoping I misheard that.
"Agreed, especially because they have a baby girl as well."
"That’s why I’m on this thread, cause that shocked me and I’m curious if it’s confirmed or if I misheard???"
"It probably has to do with us thinking because we have control, we'll be fine."
"Also probably because it’s scarier to be 30,000 feet in the air and fall to your death than to get into a car accident"
There was just an accident next to my house. Driver was texting and hit a family. I'd much rather be in a plane where the pilot is highly trained and has to undergo rigorous testing. The only thing keeping you safe when you drive is a yellow line painted on the ground
I think the biggest concern with people is that a fender bender is a bit of whiplash and an insurance call. A plane crash is almost certain death.
"Nah, the data isn't simply comparing being more likely to get in an accident, its literally comparing chance of dying, which is much much higher in cars."
"As a heli pilot myself who has trained to do auto rotations and have been with pilots who can do it with their eyes closed, I can tell you that the pilot that flew for someone of Kobe's stature was probably an elite pilot. Someone who could do autos in their sleep and controlled the helicopter like a puppet. Even so, when shit goes wrong on a heli, even the best of the best can't do much once you start to fking spin and lose all control. It's fucked up."
What are some of the possible situations that can happen that lead to spinning out of control?  Is something like that occurring more likely to be due to weather conditions or a mechanical failure?
"Highest probable causal factors considering the low vis/fog in the area (in order of likelihood):

1. Vertigo (pilot's perception of up/down/left/right didn't match reality)
2. Obstacles (tower, power line, or rising mountain terrain obscured by low visibility)
3. CFIT (Controlled flight into terrain, aka pilot doesn't notice constant steady rate descent or rising terrain)
4. Loss of Tail Rotor Drive

Likely you have a little of column 1 and column 2 which led to column 3"
helicoptering to me never seems in control. you're fighting constant changing variables. Fuck that.
"Helicopter mechanic, can confirm.

""A helicopter is just a million parts, rotating around an oil spill, waiting for metal fatigue to set in""

"" Takeoff is optional, landing is not"""
Yep my dad worked on helicopters for 11 years in the Navy... won't go anywhere near them
"Yeah, I can't imagine what he was feeling, knowing his daughter was going to die beside him. So incredibly sad."
"TMZ is mostly trash because of what they report, not because they are bad at it. Don't remember them getting much wrong."
"Agreed. Any rumours ignore TMZ. If it’s to do with someone dying, sick or in jail/legal trouble it’s probably true. The precedent has been set for defamation in those instances."
"They always get the celebrity shit right.
. That's literally their thing."
It breaks for my heart for his kids. Just had one in June. Unbelievable. I can't believe this what the actual fuck.
"Yeah i was just thinking about his daughters. He was always so involved with them, he always talked about them like they were his world. God, even just saying ""was"" feels wrong"
"Yeah. People think they're the same as the National Enquirer because their reporting is pretty sleazy, but the Enquirer isn't reliable the way TMZ is."
"Man, he was always supposed to be one of my enemies as a Celtics fan but i could never bring myself to disliking him. What the fuck. This is so fucking upsetting"
This is hard to accept for real
2020 is off to an incredibly insane start and January isn’t even over yet.
"I feel you. I’m heartbroken. Not a Kobe fan, not a Lakers fan. Doesn’t matter. Wife and 4 daughters, was only 41...it’s just devastating. Feel like I need to go call my mom."
"Bruh what really gets me is that before the game last night, me and my friends were discussing if LeBron was gonna take his foot off the pedal against the Sixers so that he could pass Kobe in scroing vs the Clippers in LA in front of a ""home"" crowd.
